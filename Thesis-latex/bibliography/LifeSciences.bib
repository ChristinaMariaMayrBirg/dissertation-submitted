 abstract = {In recent years, neurophysiological and psychological research has highlighted a pragmatic version of the theory of knowledge, a version in which the concept of simulation has been found to play a crucial role. In fact, research on canonical and mirror neurons has shown that an as if simulative schema is required to perceive, categorize and understand the meaning of the external world. The present study compares the cognitive paradigm of embodied cognition with Pierre Bourdieu's practice theory. Specifically, cognitive processes and cultural mechanisms are described as phenomena that emerge from the dynamic interaction that exists between people's practical abilities and the structure of the local environment in which they act and live. A pragmatic conception of knowledge has also emerged in the field of ethnological investigation. Indeed, the concepts of resonance and empathy have proven to be essential instruments for ethnological knowledge.},

 abstract = {An experiment was performed to examine the role of interpersonal distance preference as a mediator of short-term crowding involving close interpersonal proximity. It was expected that subjects with far interpersonal distance preferences would experience greater stress-related arousal in a crowded environment than subjects preferring closer interpersonal distances and consequently would display more physiological, behavioral, and subjective indications of discomfort. During the crowding experience, subjects preferring far interpersonal distances were found to be most physiologically stressed (as measured by electrodermal responses) and later reported having experienced greater somatic stress. Crowded subjects had higher skin conductance levels during exposure, thereafter reported greater discomfort due to restricted space, and manifested lower performance levels on creativity tasks administered immediately following crowding. Results are discussed in the context of the loss of established control processes and the breakdown of interaction-regulation mechanisms.},

The EMIL project intends to contribute to the study of social complex systems by modelling norm innovation as a phenomenon implying interrelationships among multiple levels. It shall endeavour to point out that social dynamics in societies of intelligent agents is necessarily bi-directional, which adds complexity to the emergence processes. The micro-macro link will be modelled and observed in the emergence of properties at the macro-level and their immergence into the micro-level units.

A large number of agent decision making models can be found in the literature, each inspired by different aims and research questions. In this paper we provide a review of 14 agent decision making architectures that have attracted interest. They range from production-rule systems to psychologically- and neurologically-inspired approaches. For each of the architectures we give an overview of its design, highlight research questions that have been answered with its help and outline the reasons for the choice of the decision making model provided by the originators.

 abstract = {Rather than passively waiting to be activated by sensations, it is proposed that the human brain is continuously busy generating predictions that approximate the relevant future. Building on previous work, this proposal posits that rudimentary information is extracted rapidly from the input to derive analogies linking that input with representations in memory. The linked stored representations then activate the associations that are relevant in the specific context, which provides focused predictions. These predictions facilitate perception and cognition by pre-sensitizing relevant representations. Predictions regarding complex information, such as those required in social interactions, integrate multiple analo- gies. This cognitive neuroscience framework can help explain a variety of phenomena, ranging from recognition to first impressions, and from the brain's default mode to a host of mental disorders.},

 comment = {<note author=gk> Accpording to Wael El Deredy one of the groundwork laying articles on decision making. From a psychologist's view. Proposition: Human brain is constantly generating predictions to approximate the relevant future using gist information and drawing on analogies from existing representations in the brain. What is new? Integretion of the well studied concepts of associations, analogies, predictions in one framework. Proposition of proactivness of the brain. Emphasis on the role of representations in memory in the decision process. What is important for us? The framework is a nice model if we choose to believe it. The claim that only gist information is used, could justify our simple and rough models of the reality that our peds can perceive. if they use gist infor only,. we don't need to model details. The question of what is the vital gist info, of course, remains open. Propostion that the reliance on gist info of the brain may put people "on the wrong path". This would mean that there are a number of erroneous decisions that seem "irrational". Difficult: How do we get representations in memory? How are the propositions proved? Framework: not tested directly. Test possiblilities ar proposed in the outlook: If one inclreases the number of available analogies in the memory the predictions should become better. Gist info as basis of analogies and hence predictions: Says this is known for recognition. Done by screening the brain for activity. Unclear for higher level abstraction. </note>},

@book{bar-2011-life,
 abstract = {When one is immersed in the fascinating world of neuroscience findings, the brain might start to seem like a collection of "modules," each specializes in a specific mental feat. But just like in other domains of Nature, it is possible that much of the brain and mind's operation can be explained with a small set of universal principles. Given exciting recent developments in theory, empirical findings and computational studies, it seems that the generation of predictions might be one strong candidate for such a universal principle. This is the focus of Predictions in the Brain. From the predictions required when a rat navigates a maze to food-caching in scrub-jays; from predictions essential in decision-making to social interactions; from predictions in the retina to the prefrontal cortex; and from predictions in early development to foresight in non-humans. The perspectives represented in this collection span a spectrum from the cellular underpinnings to the computational principles underlying future-related mental processes, and from systems neuroscience to cognition and emotion. In spite of this diversity, they share some core elements. Memory, for instance, is critical in any framework that explains predictions. In asking "what is next?" our brains have to refer to memory and experience on the way to simulating our mental future. But as much as this collection offers answers to important questions, it raises and emphasizes outstanding ones. How are experiences coded optimally to afford using them for predictions? How do we construct a new simulation from separate memories? How specific in detail are future-oriented thoughts, and when do they rely on imagery, concepts or language? Therefore, in addition to presenting the state-of-the-art of research and ideas about predictions as a universal principle in mind and brain, it is hoped that this collection will stimulate important new research into the foundations of our mental lives.},

@article{bateson-2007-life,
 abstract = {Abstract The idea of the innate and the acquired is a part of folk-biology but is also used by biologists, psychologists and cognitive scientists in their disciplines. Are they right to do so? Innateness is often defined by appealing to the role of genes in development, to the role of Darwinian evolution in shaping developmental processes, to the non-involvement of learning during development, to developmental robustness, and to modularity. We argue that all such definitions are unsatisfactory. Some are unsatisfactory because they are based on simplistic and empirically outmoded views of development. Others are empirically defensible but are unsatisfactory because they do not capture the full breadth of the use of the term ???innate??? and, due to this restriction, they can easily lead to inferential mistakes. The definition of acquired behavior has been used with greater sophistication and is generally regarded as being heterogeneous. Nevertheless, in as much as the overall category has been seen in opposition to the innate, it has been an obstacle to a thorough investigation of how behavior develops. We suggest that a useful way forward is to examine whether or not the empirically well-established properties often associated with the concept of innate and the concept of acquired form theoretically useful clusters. This path leads to a much fuller appreciation of the view favored by Gilbert Gottlieb, according to which development involves the continuous interplay of the organism (and its genes) with its environment.},

 abstract = {Collective decision making involves on the one hand individual mental states such as beliefs, emotions and intentions, and on the other hand interaction with others with possibly different mental states. Achieving a satisfactory common group decision on which all agree requires that such mental states are adapted to each other by social interaction. Recent developments in social neuroscience have revealed neural mechanisms by which such mutual adaptation can be realised. These mechanisms not only enable intentions to converge to an emerging common decision, but at the same time enable to achieve shared underlying individual beliefs and emotions. This paper presents a computational model for such processes. As an application of the model, an agent-based analysis was made of patterns in crowd behaviour, in particular to simulate a real-life incident that took place on May 4, 2010 in Amsterdam. From available video material and witness reports, useful empirical data were extracted. Similar patterns were achieved in simulations, whereby some of the parameters of the model were tuned to the case addressed, and most parameters were assigned default values. The results show the inclusion of contagion of belief, emotion, and intention states of agents results in better reproduction of the incident than non-inclusion.},

Nonetheless, normal males and females perform comparably on intelligence tests and human brains lack sexual dimorphism on routine neuropathological exams---other than mean differences in weight and size. Even so, human brains demonstrate: 1) a sexually dimorphic nucleus in the hypothalamus with twofold neuronal numbers in males than in females; 2) the planum temporale/anterior Sylvian fissure on the left side are larger in males; 3) some studies reveal the posterior corpus callosum to be more bulbous in females while others fail to show this difference; and 4) a cytoarchitectural study demonstrates definite sexual dimorphism of cerebral cortex with significantly higher neuronal densities and neuronal number estimates in males and a reciprocal increase in neuropil/neuronal processes in female cortex as implied by the 2 sexes' similar mean cortical thicknesses.},

A main challenge for short-term forecasts is the assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change when first interventions show an effect. By combining an established epidemiological model with Bayesian inference, we analyze the time dependence of the effective growth rate of new infections. Focusing on the COVID-19 spread in Germany, we detect change points in the effective growth rate that correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions. Thereby, we can quantify the effect of interventions, and we can incorporate the corresponding change points into forecasts of future scenarios and case numbers.

Many sociologists assume that their research methods are neutral "atheoretical tools" suitable for valid scientific use by any knowledgeable user. Despite the existence of public rules governing the enterprise called science, the values, definitions and ideologies of each scientist significantly determine the translation of rules of method into the scientific process. Triangulation, or the use of multiple methods, is a plan of action that will raise sociologists above the personalistic biases that stem from single methodologies. The chapter focuses on the inherent difficulties of generating valid sociological data. It also suggests that the resolutions to this difficulty are two-fold. First, sociologists must realize that their growth as a science is contingent on the recognition of these elements. Second, multiple strategies of triangulation are proposed as the preferred line of action.},

Although attachment theory and research propose that attachment security provides a person with many adaptive advantages during all phases of the life cycle, numerous studies indicate that almost half of the human species can be classified as insecurely attached or insecure with respect to attachment. It seems odd that evolution left humans in this vulnerable position unless there are some advantages, under at least some conditions, to anxious and avoidant attachment styles. We argue that a social group containing members with different attachment patterns may be more conducive to survival than a homogeneous group of securely attached individuals. In making this argument, we extend the scope of attachment theory and research by considering a broader range of adaptive functions of insecure attachment strategies. We also present preliminary data to support our argument.},

 abstract = {People who score high on attachment anxiety or avoidance display poorer adjustment than secure individuals in various social, emotional, and behavioral domains. Yet it may be advantageous for groups to include insecure as well as secure members. The authors tested predictions from social defense theory concerning advantages to groups of including members with different attachment patterns. A total of 46 groups were unobtrusively observed in a threatening laboratory situation: The room gradually filled with smoke, apparently because of a malfunctioning computer. Attachment anxiety was associated with quicker detection of the danger and therefore with greater group effectiveness. Attachment-related avoidance was associated with speedier escape responses to the danger once it was detected and therefore with greater group safety. The results remained significant even when extraversion and neuroticism, two possible confounds, were statistically controlled. Implications of the findings for theory and research concerning group processes, threat detection, and individual differences in attachment are discussed.},

 abstract = {Bowlby's (1982) attachment theory has generated an enormous body of research and conceptual elaborations.
Although attachment theory and research propose that attachment security provides a person
with many adaptive advantages, during all phases of the life cycle, numerous studies indicate that almost
half of the human species can be classified as insecurely attached or insecure with respect to attachment.
To date, the mainstream view in attachment theory and research is that attachment insecurity incurs
only disadvantages. I, however, argue that each attachment disposition - security, anxiety, avoidance -
has unique adaptive advantages in promoting survival. In making this argument, I extend the scope of
attachment theory and research by considering a broader range of adaptive functions of insecure attachment
strategies, and present data to support my argument.},

@book{festinger-1957-life,
 abstract = {Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance has been widely recognized for its important and influential concepts in areas of motivation and social psychology. The theory of dissonance is here applied to the problem of why partial reward, delay of reward , and effort expenditure during training result in increased resistance to extinction.
The author contends that a state of impasse exists within learning theory largely because some of its major assumptions stand in apparent opposition to cetain well-established experimental results. The book puts forward a new theory that seems to reconcile these data and assumptions. This new theory can account for data with which other theories have difficulty: it integrates empirical phenomena that have been regarded as unrelated, and it is supported by the results of experiments designed specifically to test its implications. These experiments are fully described in the text.},

 abstract = {The classical senses, vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, were first conceived as the windows of the soul. Later, and even up to the present, they were conceived as distinct channels by which messages were sent to the brain. Each has an obvious and seemingly isolated organ. The simplicity of this scheme began to break up in the nineteenth century. The list of senses had to be extended. Kinaesthesis was added, but it had to include the sense of position of the body as well as of movement. The equilibrium sense was discovered, its organs being part of the inner ``ear'' or labyrinth. Temperature and pain were added, or else made subdivisions of the skin sense. Touch itself proved to be complex. The senses were classified by Sherrington as exteroceptive, proprioceptive, and interoceptive, but these classes do not now appear to be mutually exclusive.},

It is suggested that the move from behaviorism to cognitivism is best represented in terms of the replacement of (operationally defined) ``intervening variables'' by genuine ``hypothetical constructs'' possessing cognitive ``surplus meaning,'' and that the ``cognitive revolution'' of the 1950s continued a cognitive tradition that can be traced back to the 1920s.},

The ACM were tested in two case studies conducted in Ueno Park (Tokyo). The first case study is focused on the visualization of the intensity of activity in the totality of the park. The second case study is focused in two sub-places of the park, generating representations of people's personal spaces combined into a three-dimensional Common social space. The research concludes with the analysis of the generated visualizations and their potential for incorporating place-variables into the digital design process.},

Serial processing allows only one object at a time to be processed, whereas parallel processing assumes that various objects are processed simultaneously. Here, we present novel neural models for the two types of processing mechanisms based on analysis of simultaneously recorded spike trains using electrophysiological data from prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys while processing task-relevant visual displays. We combine mathematical models describing neuronal attention and point process models for spike trains. The same model can explain both serial and parallel processing by adopting different parameter regimes. We present statistical methods to distinguish between serial and parallel processing based on both maximum likelihood estimates and decoding the momentary focus of attention when two stimuli are presented simultaneously. Results show that both processing mechanisms are in play for the simultaneously recorded neurons, but neurons tend to follow parallel processing in the beginning after the onset of the stimulus pair, whereas they tend to serial processing later on.},

Our existing crowd simulation system (MACES) performs high level wayfinding to explore unknown environments and obtain a cognitive map for navigation purposes, in addition to dealing with low level motion within each room based on social forces. Communication and roles are added to achieve individualistic behaviors and a realistic way to spread information about the environment. To expand the range of realistic human behaviors, we use a system (PMFserv) that implements human behavior models from a range of ability, stress, emotion, decision theoretic and motivation sources.

In this paper, we consider the influence of the crowd motion in a complex dynamical environment on the course of infection of the pedestrians. To model the pedestrian dynamics we consider a kinetic equation for multi-group pedestrian flow based on a social force model coupled with an Eikonal equation. This model is coupled with a non-local SEIS contagion model for disease spread, where besides the description of local contacts also the influence of contact times has been modelled. Hydrodynamic approximations of the coupled system are derived. Finally, simulations of the hydrodynamic model are carried out using a mesh-free particle method. Different numerical test cases are investigated including uni- and bi-directional flow in a passage with and without obstacles.},

The various definitions of the concept are reviewed and synthesized into a three-dimensional, person???process???place organizing framework. The person dimension of place attachment refers to its individually or collectively determined meanings. The psychological dimension includes the affective, cognitive, and behavioral components of attachment. The place dimension emphasizes the place characteristics of attachment, including spatial level, specificity, and the prominence of social or physical elements. In addition, potential functions of place attachment are reviewed. The framework organizes related place attachment concepts and thus clarifies the term. The framework may also be used to stimulate new research, investigate multidimensionality, create operational definitions for quantitative studies, guide semi-structured interviews for qualitative studies, and assist in conflict resolution for successful land-use management.},

 abstract = {Formal models are commonly used in natural resource management (NRM) to study human-environment interactions and inform policy making. In the majority of applications, human behaviour is represented by the rational actor model despite growing empirical evidence of its shortcomings in NRM contexts. While the importance of accounting for the complexity of human behaviour is increasingly recognized, its integration into formal models remains a major challenge. The challenges are multiple: i) there exist many theories scattered across the social sciences, ii) most theories cover only a certain aspect of decision-making, iii) they vary in their degree of formalization, iv) causal mechanisms are often not specified. We provide a framework- MoHuB (Modelling Human Behavior) - to facilitate a broader inclusion of theories on human decision-making in formal NRM models. It serves as a tool and common language to describe, compare and communicate alternative theories. In doing so, we not only enhance understanding of commonalities and differences between theories, but take a first step towards tackling the challenges mentioned above. This approach may enable modellers to find and formalize relevant theories, and be more explicit and inclusive about theories of human decision making in the analysis of social-ecological systems.},

crowds. This can enhance crowd safety at large events and transport hubs, and increase efficiency such
as capacity utilization in public transport systems. However, the models used are mainly based on video
observations, not an understanding of human decision making. Theories of crowd psychology can
elucidate the factors underpinning collective behavior in human crowds. Yet, in contrast to psychology,
computer science must rely upon mathematical formulations in order to implement algorithms and keep
models manageable. Here, we address the problems and possible solutions encountered when incorporating
social psychological theories of collective behavior in computer modeling. We identify that one
primary issue is retaining parsimony in a model while avoiding reductionism by excluding necessary
aspects of crowd psychology, such as the behavior of groups. We propose cognitive heuristics as a
potential avenue to create a parsimonious model that incorporates core concepts of collective behavior
derived from empirical research in crowd psychology.},

The writer has no sympathy for the controversy between the individual and the social approaches. The individual is regarded as basic, and any valid psychological principle should apply to the individual, alone, in a group, or in relation to his whole culture. Throughout psychology, in perception, in judgment, in affectivity, etc., the frame of reference is shown to be an important determinant of experience. Variations in culture are shown to be variations in frames of reference common to various groups. Social frames of reference (social norms, i.e. values, customs, stereotypes, conventions, etc.) are regarded first as stimuli which meet the individual in his associations with others and then become interiorized. The process of establishing a social norm is illustrated experimentally in an unstable perceptual situation (autokinetic phenomenon). Observing alone, the individual establishes his own frame of reference, which is modified in the direction of conformity when he observes in a group. Observing first in a group, frames of reference are set up which determine subsequent reports when the individual observes alone (illustrating the factual basis for the contentions that supra-individual qualities arise in group situations). Social values in relation to personal needs are discussed in the light of this experiment. A final chapter describes "human nature" as dependent upon the norms peculiar to the individual's group.},

Our model is formed by integrating connectionist, reinforcement, and symbolic learning methods to perform on-line reactive learning. It adopts a two-level dual-representation framework (Sun, 1995), with a combination of localist and distributed representation. We compare the model with human data in a minefield navigation task, demonstrating some match between the model and human data in several respects.},

To date, however, progress in the study of interpersonal distance (IPD) has been inhibited by poor operational definitions and inadequate measurement methodologies. For our own investigation, we innovated on methodology by devising the digital video-recording IPD method (DiVRID) that records interpersonal spatial relationships using high quality digital video equipment. The findings highlighted not only the validity of our innovative method of investigation, but also that a more sophisticated conceptualization of the impact of gender on IPD is warranted than can be accounted for by biological sex differences. In this study, we found that gender role accounts for more of the variation in IPD than the conventionally reported gender variable, sex.},

It was predicted that violation of personal space rather than simple density is the spatial variable associated with crowding and that the experience of crowding can be alleviated if the individual is distracted from making the attribution that his or her arousal is caused by other people. To test these predictions, interaction distance (close and far) and density (high and low) were varied separately in a study with 315 male undergraduates. For half of the conditions, pictures (attribution inhibitors) were placed on the walls of the experimental room, and in the other half, the walls were bare. Ss worked on 2 tasks and were then questioned about their experience of crowding. Interaction distance was more closely related to crowding than density, and pictures reduced the experiences of crowding only in the close interaction conditions. Results support the attribution analysis of crowding. (27 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

 abstract = {The primate visual motion system performs numerous functions essential for survival in a dynamic visual world. Prominent among these functions is the ability to recover and represent the trajectories of objects in a form that facilitates behavioral responses to those movements. The first step toward this goal, which consists of detecting the displacement of retinal image features, has been studied for many years in both psychophysical and neurobiological experiments. Evidence indicates that achievement of this step is computationally straightforward and occurs at the earliest cortical stage. The second step involves the selective integration of retinal motion signals according to the object of origin. Realization of this step is computationally demanding, as the solution is formally underconstrained. It must rely--by definition--upon utilization of retinal cues that are indicative of the spatial relationships within and between objects in the visual scene. Psychophysical experiments have documented this dependence and suggested mechanisms by which it may be achieved. Neurophysiological experiments have provided evidence for a neural substrate that may underlie this selective motion signal integration. Together they paint a coherent portrait of the means by which retinal image motion gives rise to our perceptual experience of moving objects.},

 abstract = {It is natural to think that in perceiving dynamic scenes, vision takes a series of snapshots. Motion perception can ensue when the snapshots are different. The snapshot metaphor suggests two questions: (i) How does the visual system put together elements within each snapshot to form objects? This is the spatial grouping problem. (ii) When the snapshots are different, how does the visual system know which element in one snapshot corresponds to which element in the next? This is the temporal grouping problem. The snapshot metaphor is a caricature of the dominant model in the field-the sequential model-according to which spatial and temporal grouping are independent. The model we propose here is an interactive model, according to which the two grouping mechanisms are not separable. Currently, the experiments that support the interactive model are not conclusive because they use stimuli that are excessively specialized. To overcome this weakness, we created a new type of stimulus-spatiotemporal dot lattices-which allow us to independently manipulate the strength of spatial and temporal groupings. For these stimuli, sequential models make one fundamental assumption: if the spatial configuration of the stimulus remains constant, the perception of spatial grouping cannot be affected by manipulations of the temporal configuration of the stimulus. Our data are inconsistent with this assumption.},

 abstract = {It is difficult to identify a target in the peripheral visual field when it is flanked by distractors. In the present study, we investigated this "crowding" effect for biological motion stimuli. Three walking biological motion stimuli were presented horizontally in the periphery with various distances between them, and observers reported the walking direction of the central figure. When the inter-walker distance was small, discriminating the direction became difficult. Moreover, the reported direction for the central target was not simply noisier, but reflected a degree of pooling of the three directions from the target and two flankers. However, when the two flanking distractors were scrambled walking biological motion stimuli, crowding was not seen. This result suggests that the crowding of biological motion stimuli occurs at a high-level of motion perception.},

 abstract = {In natural behavior, fixation patterns are tightly linked to the ongoing task. However, a critical problem for task-driven systems is dealing with unexpected stimuli. We studied the effect of unexpected potential collisions with pedestrians on the distribution of gaze of subjects walking in a virtual environment. Pedestrians on a collision course with the subject were surprisingly ineffective in evoking fixations, especially when subjects were additionally occupied with another task, suggesting that potential collisions do not automatically attract attention. However, prior fixations on pedestrians did increase collision detection performance. Additionally, the detection of potential collisions led to a short-term change in the strategy of looking at subsequent pedestrians. The overall pattern of results is consistent with the hypothesis that subjects typically rely on mechanisms that are initiated top-down to detect unexpected events such as potential collisions. For this to be effective, subjects must learn an appropriate schedule for initiating search through experience with the probabilities of environmental events.},

@article{wexler-2013-life,
 abstract = {When human observers are exposed to even slight motion signals followed by brief visual transients-stimuli containing no detectable coherent motion signals-they perceive large and salient illusory jumps. This visually striking effect, which we call "high phi," challenges well-entrenched assumptions about the perception of motion, namely the minimal-motion principle and the breakdown of coherent motion perception with steps above an upper limit called dmax. Our experiments with transients, such as texture randomization or contrast reversal, show that the magnitude of the jump depends on spatial frequency and transient duration-but not on the speed of the inducing motion signals-and the direction of the jump depends on the duration of the inducer. Jump magnitude is robust across jump directions and different types of transient. In addition, when a texture is actually displaced by a large step beyond the upper step size limit of dmax, a breakdown of coherent motion perception is expected; however, in the presence of an inducer, observers again perceive coherent displacements at or just above dmax. In summary, across a large variety of stimuli, we find that when incoherent motion noise is preceded by a small bias, instead of perceiving little or no motion-as suggested by the minimal-motion principle-observers perceive jumps whose amplitude closely follows their own dmax limits.},

 abstract = {Collective intelligence refers to the ability of groups to outperform individual decision makers when solving complex cognitive problems. Despite its potential to revolutionize decision making in a wide range of domains, including medical, economic, and political decision making, at present, little is known about the conditions underlying collective intelligence in real-world contexts. We here focus on two key areas of medical diagnostics, breast and skin cancer detection. Using a simulation study that draws on large real-world datasets, involving more than 140 doctors making more than 20,000 diagnoses, we investigate when combining the independent judgments of multiple doctors outperforms the best doctor in a group. We find that similarity in diagnostic accuracy is a key condition for collective intelligence: Aggregating the independent judgments of doctors outperforms the best doctor in a group whenever the diagnostic accuracy of doctors is relatively similar, but not when doctors' diagnostic accuracy differs too much. This intriguingly simple result is highly robust and holds across different group sizes, performance levels of the best doctor, and collective intelligence rules. The enabling role of similarity, in turn, is explained by its systematic effects on the number of correct and incorrect decisions of the best doctor that are overruled by the collective. By identifying a key factor underlying collective intelligence in two important real-world contexts, our findings pave the way for innovative and more effective approaches to complex real-world decision making, and to the scientific analyses of those approaches.},

 abstract = {Nanometre-scale contact experiments and simulations demonstrate the potential to probe incipient plasticity - the onset of permanent deformation - in crystals. Such studies also point to the need for an understanding of the mechanisms governing defect nucleation in a broad range of fields and applications. Here we present a fundamental framework for describing incipient plasticity that combines results of atomistic and finite-element modelling, theoretical concepts of structural stability at finite strain, and experimental analysis. We quantify two key features of the nucleation and subsequent evolution of defects. A position-sensitive criterion based on elastic stability determines the location and character of homogeneously nucleated defects. We validate this stability criterion at both the atomistic and the continuum levels. We then propose a detailed interpretation of the experimentally observed sequence of displacement bursts to elucidate the role of secondary defect sources operating locally at stress levels considerably smaller than the ideal strength required for homogeneous nucleation. These findings provide a self-consistent explanation of the discontinuous elastic-plastic response in nanoindentation measurements, and a guide to fundamental studies across many disciplines that seek to quantify and predict the initiation and early stages of plasticity.},

 abstract = {Financial markets (share markets, foreign exchange markets and others) are all characterized by a number of universal power laws. The most prominent example is the ubiquitous finding of a robust, approximately cubic power law characterizing the distribution of large returns. A similarly robust feature is long-range dependence in volatility (i.e., hyperbolic decline of its autocorrelation function). The recent literature adds temporal scaling of trading volume and multi-scaling of higher moments of returns. Increasing awareness of these properties has recently spurred attempts at theoretical explanations of the emergence of these key characteristics form the market process. In principle, different types of dynamic processes could be responsible for these power-laws. Examples to be found in the economics literature include multiplicative stochastic processes as well as dynamic processes with multiple equilibria. Though both types of dynamics are characterized by intermittent behavior which occasionally generates large bursts of activity, they can be based on fundamentally different perceptions of the trading process. The present chapter reviews both the analytical background of the power laws emerging from the above data generating mechanism as well as pertinent models proposed in the economics literature.},

However, no previous study has examined the possibility of subliminal processing of perceptual grouping. The present work steps forward in the study of perceptual organization, reporting direct evidence of subliminal processing of Gestalt patterns. In two masked priming experiments, Gestalt patterns grouped by proximity or similarity that induced either a horizontal or vertical global orientation of the stimuli were presented as masked primes and followed by visible targets that could be congruent or incongruent with the orientation of the primes. The results showed a reliable priming effect in the complete absence of prime awareness for both proximity and similarity grouping principles. These findings suggest that a phenomenal report of the Gestalt pattern is not mandatory to observe an effect on the response based on the global properties of Gestalt stimuli.},

It is argued that the structure of system dynamics models implicitly assumes bounded rationality in decision making and that recognition of this assumption would aid system dynamicists in model construction and in communication with other social science disciplines. The paper begins by examining Simon's "principle of bounded rationality" which draws attention to the cognitive limitations on the information gathering and processing powers of human decision makers. Forrester's "Market Growth Model" is used to illustrate the central theme that system dynamics models are portrayals of bounded rationality. Close examination of the model formulation reveals decision functions involving simple rules of thumb and limited information content. Finally, there is a discussion of the implications of Carnegie philosophy for system dynamics as it affects communication, model structuring, model analysis and future research.},

 abstract = {Publisher Summary The chapter aims to criticize the postulates underlying the current studies on social influence and discard the one-sided association of social influence with questions and facts related to conformity and deviance. It shows several new directions, both conceptual and experimental, which could lead to an understanding of innovation; and demonstrates the importance of behavior style as a general source of social influence. Power effects and influence effects have been differentiated and have shown that the latter play a specific role in assigning attributes. Intraindividual consistency and interindividual consistency have a vital function in these inferential phenomena. They also have a vital function in processes related to influence. The chapter provides the different ways in which a consensus is arrived at: when the majority partner has a norm and the minority partner is deprived of any norm; when partners are equals and each is in possession of his or her own norm; and when the minority partner has a norm, which he or she opposes to the norm of the majority partner. Because a consensus is a result and a form of treating social conflict, by reducing the variation of inter and intraindividual responses, the chapter also dealt with the modalities of social influence-the dynamics of social conflict. The chapter develops a set of hypotheses and an experimental paradigm that allows beginning a study of innovation and of the influence of minorities on majorities. This is possible regardless of the nature of the norm (implicit or explicit), and that it can occur at the response level as well as the coding level. Special attention has been given to the direction of this influence, distinguishing between approach, avoidance, and polarization in relation to the minority.},

 abstract = {One of the major breakthroughs in neuroscience is the emerging understanding of how signals from the external environment are extracted and represented in the primary sensory cortices of the mammalian brain. The operational principles of the rest of the cortex, however, have essentially remained in the dark. The discovery of grid cells, and their functional organization, opens the door to some of the first insights into the workings of the association cortices, at a stage of neural processing where firing properties are shaped not primarily by the nature of incoming sensory signals but rather by internal self-organizing principles. Grid cells are place-modulated neurons whose firing locations define a periodic triangular array overlaid on the entire space available to a moving animal. The unclouded firing pattern of these cells is rare within the association cortices. In this paper, we shall review recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of grid-cell formation which suggest that the pattern originates by competitive network interactions, and we shall relate these ideas to new insights regarding the organization of grid cells into functionally segregated modules.

An extended review of Rational Choice Theory (RCT) from its first developments to current trends makes explicit the mismatch between RCT and empirical work settings. A review of recent theories on the cognitive abilities of agents makes clear the lack of integration between findings in evolutionary psychology, cognitive science, perceptual psychology and neurology, and those proposed by RCT. We will examine the causes for the failure of Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI), the strongest empirical program for testing RCT premises. Contributions from the cognitive and social sciences put forward the weaknesses of analytical sociology at all four levels: the biological, the psychological, the epistemological, and the ontological. Alternative explanations from contemporary cognitive science will be put forward.},

Ss are sometimes (a) unaware of the existence of a stimulus that importantly influenced a response, (b) unaware of the existence of the response, and (c) unaware that the stimulus has affected the response. It is proposed that when people attempt to report on their cognitive processes, that is, on the processes mediating the effects of a stimulus on a response, they do not do so on the basis of any true introspection. Instead, their reports are based on a priori, implicit causal theories, or judgments about the extent to which a particular stimulus is a plausible cause of a given response. This suggests that though people may not be able to observe directly their cognitive processes, they will sometimes be able to report accurately about them. Accurate reports will occur when influential stimuli are salient and are plausible causes of the responses they produce, and will not occur when stimuli are not salient or are not plausible causes.},

Common fate seems to operate in sudden impact disasters (e.g., bombings), but to our knowledge, no research has explored social identity processes in rising-tide incidents. We interviewed an opportunity sample of 17 residents of York, United Kingdom, who were involved in the 2015-2016 floods.
Using thematic and discourse analysis, we investigated residents' experiences of the floods and the strategic function that invocations of community identities perform. 
We show how shared community identities emerged (e.g., because of shared problems, shared goals, perceptions of vulnerability, and collapse of previous group boundaries) and show how they acted as a basis of social support (both given and expected). The findings serve to further develop the social identity model of collective psychosocial resilience in rising tide disasters. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.},

 abstract = {If there was a single best way to design a house to live in, all modern houses would be the same, but they are not: typical modern Japanese houses are not the same as typical modern British ones. As cultural values vary, so do psychological needs; and house form changes accordingly. The basic boundaries in the house are expressions of social classifications which regulate human behaviour, and boundaries are a useful focus when considering the meaning and cultural variation of house design. In the present study, data on spatial boundaries (house plans) are interpreted in the light of the Japanese emphasis on the inside---outside classification, which not only forms a physical demarcation in and around the house but also creates and reinforces psychological boundaries in human relationships. The social boundaries which define and maintain this classification are also evident in phenomenological accounts of Japanese people resident in the United Kingdom.},

The articles of this special issue on cognitive load theory discuss new conceptualizations of the different categories of cognitive load, an integrated research perspective of process-oriented and cognitive load approaches to collaborative learning, an integrated research perspective of cognitive and social--cognitive approaches to example-based learning, and a specification of the theory focusing on the acquisition of generalized knowledge structures as a means to facilitate flexible problem-solving skills. This article provides a short introduction to the theory, discusses some of its recent advances, and provides an overview of the contributions to this issue.},

In follow-up laboratory studies, upper-class individuals were more likely to exhibit unethical decision-making tendencies (study 3), take valued goods from others (study 4), lie in a negotiation (study 5), cheat to increase their chances of winning a prize (study 6), and endorse unethical behavior at work (study 7) than were lower-class individuals.

 abstract = {Animals process sensory information according to specific computational rules and, subsequently, form representations of their environments that form the basis for decisions and choices. The specific computational rules used by organisms will often be evolutionarily adaptive by generating higher probabilities of survival, reproduction, and resource acquisition. Experiments with enclosed colonies of bumblebees constrained to foraging on artificial flowers suggest that the bumblebee's cognitive architecture is designed to efficiently exploit floral resources from spatially structured environments given limits on memory and the neuronal processing of information. A non-linear relationship between the biomechanics of nectar extraction and rates of net energetic gain by individual bees may account for sensitivities to both the arithmetic mean and variance in reward distributions in flowers. Heuristic rules that lead to efficient resource exploitation may also lead to subjective misperception of likelihoods. Subjective probability formation may then be viewed as a problem in pattern recognition subject to specific sampling schemes and memory constraints.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the cognitive architecture of human action, showing how it is organized over several levels and how it is built up. Basic action concepts (BACs) are identified as major building blocks on a representation level. These \{BACs\} are cognitive tools for mastering the functional demands of movement tasks. Results from different lines of research showed that not only the structure formation of mental representations in long-term memory but also chunk formation in working memory are built up on \{BACs\} and relate systematically to movement structures. It is concluded that such movement representations might provide the basis for action implementation and action control in skilled voluntary movements in the form of cognitive reference structures. To simulate action implementation we discuss challenges and issues that arise when we try to replicate complex movement abilities in robots. Among the key issues to be addressed is the question how structured representations can arise during skill acquisition and how the underlying processes can be understood sufficiently succinctly to replicate them on robot platforms. Working towards this goal, we translate our findings in studies of motor control in humans into models that can guide the implementation of cognitive robot architectures. Focusing on the issue of manual action control, we illustrate some results in the context of grasping with a five-fingered anthropomorphic robot hand.},

The issues included use of visual vs acoustic Ta information, use of acoustic Ta information by blind Ss, use of Ta information controlling for velocity, and effects of angle of approach and arrival time on judgment accuracy. Visual information was used more efficiently than audiovisual and auditory information. Blind Ss used acoustical approach information as accurately as sighted Ss used visual information. Radial, oblique, and transverse orientations were used to examine effects of approach trajectory. Radial events were underestimated, whereas the more accurate transverse approach was likely to be overestimated. Oblique angle events yielded intermediate accuracies implying a spatiotemporal anisotropy. Women underestimated Ta more than did men. Possible reasons for Ss' judgment accuracy, including linear vs nonlinear optical changes and relation to spatial skills and experience, were discussed.},

The 1st 3 studies demonstrated that Ss were more likely to respond to an intruder than to a service provider who interrupts the service for a specific amount of time even though waiting costs were manipulated to be identical in both situations. Results indicated that the queuer right behind the intrusion point has a special obligation to respond to the intrusion. In a field experiment, queuers were more likely to respond to an illegitimate than to a legitimate intrusion, and queuers' reactions were subject to social influence. Results suggest that the queue constitutes a social system. Future research and practical applications for the management of waiting queues are discussed.

 abstract = {A perceiver's actions, although based upon initially erroneous beliefs about a target individual may channel social interaction in ways that cause the behavior of the target to confirm the perceiver's beliefs. To chart this process of behavioral confirmation, we observed successive interactions between one target and two perceivers. In the first interaction, targets who interacted with perceivers who anticipated hostile partners displayed greater behavioral hostility than targets whose perceivers expected nonhostile partners. Only when targets regarded their actions as reflections of personal dispositions did these behavioral differences in hostility persevere into their subsequent interactions with naive perceivers who had no prior knowledge about them. Theoretical implications of the behavioral confirmation construct for social perception processes are discussed.},

 abstract = {Modern cognitive psychology has strictly adhered to the experimental methodology of the natural sciences. Often, contributions in Theory \& Psychology have addressed shortcomings and possible remedies of this predominant approach and its emphasis on `effects'. My comment contrasts this approach with the generative theories (cognitive simulation models) developed in cognitive science about 30 years ago and still not widely accepted in psychology. I characterize these generative theories, and discuss their weaknesses and their advantages over the usual way of theorizing in cognitive psychology. I hope to convince at least some readers that (a) in order to proceed in this manner, you need not buy a ready-made `cognitive architecture', and (b) that this approach results in a much more rigorous theorizing (although still well controllable as a scientific endeavor).},

 abstract = {Human bipedalism is commonly thought to have evolved from a quadrupedal terrestrial precursor, yet some recent paleontological evidence suggests that adaptations for bipedalism arose in an arboreal context. However, the adaptive benefit of arboreal bipedalism has been unknown. Here we show that it allows the most arboreal great ape, the orangutan, to access supports too flexible to be negotiated otherwise. Orangutans react to branch flexibility like humans running on springy tracks, by increasing knee and hip extension, whereas all other primatesdothe reverse. Human bipedalism is thus less an innovation than an exploitation of a locomotor behavior retained from the common great ape ancestor.},

@article{todd-2000-life,
 abstract = {How can anyone be rational in a world where knowledge is limited, time is pressing, and deep thought is often an unattainable luxury? Traditional models of unbounded rationality and optimization in cognitive science, economics, and animal behavior have tended to view decision-makers as possessing supernatural powers of reason, limitless knowledge, and endless time. But understanding decisions in the real world requires a more psychologically plausible notion of bounded rationality. In Simple heuristics that make us smart (Gigerenzer et al. 1999), we explore fast and frugal heuristics - simple rules in the mind's adaptive toolbox for making decisions with realistic mental resources. These heuristics can enable both living organisms and artificial systems to make smart choices quickly and with a minimum of information by exploiting the way that information is structured in particular environments. In this pr\'{e}cis, we show how simple building blocks that control information search, stop search, and make decisions can be put together to form classes of heuristics, including: ignorance-based and one-reason decision making for choice, elimination models for categorization, and satisficing heuristics for sequential search. These simple heuristics perform comparably to more complex algorithms, particularly when generalizing to new data - that is, simplicity leads to robustness. We present evidence regarding when people use simple heuristics and describe the challenges to be addressed by this research program.},

Yet, pride differs from the basic emotions in its dependency on self-evaluations and in its complex structure, which is comprised of two theoretically and conceptually distinct facets that have divergent personality correlates and cognitive antecedents. In this article, we summarize findings from the growing body of research on pride and highlight the implications of this research for a broader understanding of emotions and social behavior.},

Collectivists are closely linked individuals who view themselves primarily as parts of a whole, be it a family, a network of co-workers, a tribe, or a nation. Such people are mainly motivated by the norms and duties imposed by the collective entity. Individualists are motivated by their own preferences, needs, and rights, giving priority to personal rather than to group goals.
Triandis challenges the view that psychology is universal, offering evidence for culture-specific influences on thought and action. We learn that the cultural patterns represented by individualism and collectivism lead people to view their worlds through different lenses, attaching different meanings to life events. Triandis explains how these variations in meaning can help us better understand why crime rates, divorce rates, levels of self-esteem, feelings of well-being, and indeed overall behavioral patterns can be so different from one society to another.},

 abstract = {Most research on activist participation has aimed to explain motives to engage in protest and collective action or becoming an activist. The outcomes, for the individual, have been neglected. Therefore, we set out to systematically document and organize the psychological and behavioural changes associated with activism into a typology of change. The review contains 57 papers describing changes. Psychological changes identified in the literature can be classified into 19 main forms: marital status, children, relationship ties, work-life/career, extended involvement, consumer behaviour, identity, empowerment, radicalization/politicization, legitimacy, sustained commitment, self-esteem, general well-being, traits, self-confidence, religion, organizing, knowledge and home skills. Our analysis highlights the lack of analysis of the relation between type of protest and type of change, and lack of research into the processes behind the various psychological changes. What is needed now is more precise investigation of the relationship between types of protests, social and psychological processes, and psychological outcomes. Further, more longitudinal studies are required to explore the relationship.},

 abstract = {The navigational system of the mammalian cortex comprises a number of interacting brain regions. Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex and place cells in the hippocampus are thought to participate in the formation of a dynamic representation of the animal's current location, and these cells are presumably critical for storing the representation in memory. To traverse the environment, animals must be able to translate coordinate information from spatial maps in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus into body-centered representations that can be used to direct locomotion. How this is done remains an enigma. We propose that the posterior parietal cortex is critical for this transformation.},

In the method, the torque compensation adaptive excitation control strategy is used for sagittal control and PID is applied to the upper body for the robots lateral stability. It is verified by the co-simulation based on ADAMS and MATLAB that the bipedal robot can reach the stable humanoid gait with the high energy efficiency.},

 abstract = {Simple mathematical models capable of walking or running are used to compare the merits of bipedal gaits. Stride length, duty factor (the fraction of the stride, for which the foot is on the ground) and the pattern of force on the ground are varied, and the optimum gait is deemed to be the one that minimizes the positive work that the muscles must perform, per unit distance travelled. Even the simplest model, whose legs have neither mass nor elastic compliance, predicts the changes of duty factor and force pattern that people make as they increase their speed of walking. It predicts a sudden change to running at a critical speed, but this is much faster than the speed at which people make the change. When elastic compliance is incorporated in the model, unnaturally fast walking becomes uncompetitive. However, a slow run with very brief foot contact becomes the optimum gait at low speeds, at which people would walk, unless severe energy dissipation occurs in the compliance. A model whose legs have mass as well as elastic compliance predicts well the relationship between speed and stride length in human walking.},

The authors propose that modularity, cleanly defined, provides a useful framework for directing research and resolving debates about individual cognitive systems and the nature of human evolved cognition. Modularity is a fundamental property of living things at every level of organization; it might prove indispensable for understanding the structure of the mind as well.},

 abstract = {Common coding proposes a shared representation in the brain between perception, execution, and imagination of movement. This neural-level representation is considered to support a "direct activation" of action by perception/imagination of movement at the behavioral level. We examine how this two-tier model, where a representation at the neural level supports "direct activation" at the behavioral level, relates to the notion of situatedness---the real-time access and use of environment structure for cognition. Reviewing four leading environment-oriented approaches to cognition (ecological psychology, situated action, distributed cognition, and ecological rationality), we show that the access and use of the environment structures proposed by three of these approaches require a mechanism that supports both representations and direct access. We argue that the two-tier common coding model provides such an integrated mechanism, and, further, it extends and refines the notion of direct perception.},

 abstract = {The spatial environments in which humans and animals navigate tend to be complex and dynamic, and are often characterized by information shortage. Getting around is a fundamental, adaptive problem for many individuals, but one they are capable of solving with remarkable speed and accuracy. In this chapter, it is argued that what on occasion appears to be a complex behavior based on internal representations is often the outcome of simple mechanisms - termed fast and frugal heuristics - and their interaction with the environment. Thus, the spatial navigation decisions made by individuals can be characterized as "good enough" rather than optimal, and are often crucially dependent on the environments in which they operate. This chapter reviews approaches from navigation research that differ in their emphasis on environment versus internal spatial representations in explaining movement behavior and offers an explanation of human movement behavior in terms of relatively simple mechanisms that can exploit properties of the task environment. The main contention put forward here is that a large part of explanatory power would be lost by focusing merely on the underlying cognitive processes without reference to the structure of the environment(s) in which those processes operate.},

 abstract = {People often act in order to realize desired outcomes, or goals. Although behavioral science recognizes that people can skillfully pursue goals without consciously attending to their behavior once these goals are set, conscious will is considered to be the starting point of goal pursuit. Indeed, when we decide to work hard on a task, it feels as if that conscious decision is the first and foremost cause of our behavior. That is, we are likely to say, if asked, that the decision to act produced the actions themselves. Recent discoveries, however, challenge this causal status of conscious will. They demonstrate that under some conditions, actions are initiated even though we are unconscious of the goals to be attained or their motivating effect on our behavior. Here we analyze how goal pursuit can possibly operate unconsciously.},

We illustrate this by describing our recent work on grouping under conditions of inattention, on change blindness for background events and the residual processing of undetected background changes, on modal versus amodal completion in visual search, and the differential effects of these two forms of completion on attentional processes, and on attentional modulation of lateral interactions thought to arise in early visual cortex. Many of these results indicate that segmentation processes substantially constrain attentional processes, but the reverse influence is also apparent, suggesting an interactive architecture. We discuss how the 'proto-objects' revealed by studies of segmentation and attention (i.e. the segmented perceptual units which constrain selectivity) may relate to other object-based notions in cognitive science, and we wrestle with their relation to phenomenal visual awareness.},

 abstract = {Integration of multiple sensory cues is essential for precise and accurate perception and behavioral performance, yet the reliability of sensory signals can vary across modalities and viewing conditions. Human observers typically employ the optimal strategy of weighting each cue in proportion to its reliability, but the neural basis of this computation remains poorly understood. We trained monkeys to perform a heading discrimination task from visual and vestibular cues, varying cue reliability randomly. The monkeys appropriately placed greater weight on the more reliable cue, and population decoding of neural responses in the dorsal medial superior temporal area closely predicted behavioral cue weighting, including modest deviations from optimality. We found that the mathematical combination of visual and vestibular inputs by single neurons is generally consistent with recent theories of optimal probabilistic computation in neural circuits. These results provide direct evidence for a neural mechanism mediating a simple and widespread form of statistical inference.},

 abstract = {Traditional analyses of the curve fitting problem maintain that the data do not indicate what form the fitted curve should take. Rather, this issue is said to be settled by prior probabilities, by simplicity, or by a background theory. In this paper, we describe a result due to Akaike [1973], which shows how the data can underwrite an inference concerning the curve's form based on an estimate of how predictively accurate it will be. We argue that this approach throws light on the theoretical virtues of parsimoniousness, unification, and non ad hocness, on the dispute about Bayesianism, and on empiricism and scientific realism.},

At issue is the imposition of unnecessarily narrow norms of sound reasoning that are used to diagnose so-called cognitive illusions and the continuing reliance on vague heuristics that explain everything and nothing. D. Kahneman and A. Tversky (see record 199601780-007) incorrectly asserted that Gigerenzer simply claimed that frequency formats make all cognitive illusions disappear. In contrast, Gigerenzer has proposed and tested models that actually predict when frequency judgments are valid and when they are not. The issue is not whether or not, or how often, cognitive illusions disappear. The focus should be rather the construction of detailed models of cognitive processes that explain when and why they disappear. A postscript responds to Kahneman and Tversky's (see record 199601780-007) postscript.},

In contrast, many models of rational inference treat the mind as a Laplacean Demon, equipped with unlimited time, knowledge, and computational might. Following H. Simon's notion of satisficing, the authors have proposed a family of algorithms based on a simple psychological mechanism: one-reason decision making. These fast and frugal algorithms violate fundamental tenets of classical rationality: They neither look up nor integrate all information. By computer simulation, the authors held a competition between the satisficing "Take The Best" algorithm and various "rational" inference procedures (e.g., multiple regression). The Take The Best algorithm matched or outperformed all competitors in inferential speed and accuracy. This result is an existence proof that cognitive mechanisms capable of successful performance in the real world do not need to satisfy the classical norms of rational inference.},

 abstract = {The design of a knee joint is a key issue in robotics and biomechanics to improve the compatibility between prosthesis and human movements, and to improve the bipedal robot performances. We propose a novel design for the knee joint of a planar bipedal robot, based on a four-bar linkage. The dynamic model of the planar bipedal robot is calculated. Two kinds of cyclic walking gaits are considered. The first gait is composed of successive single support phases with stance flat-foot on the ground separated by impacts. The second gait is a succession of finite time double support phases, single support phases, and impacts. During the double support phase, both feet rotate. This phase is ended by an impact of the toe of the forward foot, while the rear foot is taking off. The single support phase is ended by an impact of the swing foot heel, the other foot keeping contact with the ground through its toe. For both gaits, the reference trajectories of the rotational joints are prescribed by cubic spline functions in time. A parametric optimization problem is presented for the determination of the parameters corresponding to the optimal cyclic walking gaits. The main contribution of this paper is the design of a dynamical stable walking gait with double support phases with feet rotation, impacts, and single support phases for this bipedal robot.},

 abstract = {It is assumed that people seek positive self-regard; that is, they are motivated to possess, enhance, and maintain positive self-views. The cross-cultural generalizability of such motivations was addressed by examining Japanese culture. Anthropological, sociological, and psychological analyses revealed that many elements of Japanese culture are incongruent with such motivations. Moreover, the empirical literature provides scant evidence for a need for positive self-regard among Japanese and indicates that a self-critical focus is more characteristic of Japanese. It is argued that the need for self-regard must be culturally variant because the constructions of self and regard themselves differ across cultures. The need for positive self-regard, as it is currently conceptualized, is not a universal, but rather is rooted in significant aspects of North American culture. Conventional interpretations of positive self-regard are too narrow to encompass the Japanese experience.},

@book{hobbes-1651-life,
 abstract = {Leviathan or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil, commonly called Leviathan is a book written in 1651 by Thomas Hobbes. It is titled after the biblical Leviathan. The book concerns the structure of society, as is evidenced by the full title. In the book, Thomas Hobbes argues for a social contract and rule by an absolute sovereign. Influenced by the English Civil War, Hobbes wrote that chaos or civil war could only be averted by strong central government. He thus denied any right of rebellion toward the social contract, which would be later added by John Locke and conserved by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. (However, Hobbes did discuss the possible dissolution of the State. Since the social contract was made to institute a state that would provide for the "peace and defense" of the people, the contract would become void as soon as the government no longer protected its citizens. By virtue of this fact, man would automatically return to the state of nature until a new contract is made). -- Excerpted from Leviathan (book) on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.},

@article{hunt-1994-life,
 abstract = {Contexts that elicit bipedalism in extant apes may provide evidence of the selective pressures that led to hominid bipedalism. Bipedalism was observed most commonly among chimpanzees when they fed on the small fruits of diminutive, open-forest trees. Chimpanzees fed bipedally from such trees either by reaching up to pick fruit while standing on the ground, or from within the tree, in which case bipedalism was frequently stabilized by grasping an overhead branch. The food-gathering function of chimpanzee bipedalism suggests that hominid bipedalism may have evolved in conjunction with arm-hanging as a specialized feeding adaptation that allowed for efficient harvesting of fruits among open-forest or woodland trees. Such evidence is particularly valuable when it is in accord with fossil anatomy. Australopithecus afarensis has features of the hand, shoulder and torso that have been related to arm-hanging in chimpanzees. The australopithecine hip and hind limb clearly indicate bipedalism, but also indicate a less than optimal adaptation to bipedal locomotion compared to modern humans. Locomotor inefficiency supports the hypothesis that bipedalism evolved more as a terrestrial feeding posture than as a walking adaptation. A bipedal postural feeding adaptation may have been a preadaptation for the fully realized locomotor bipedalism apparent in Homo erectus.},

@article{hutchinson-2005-life,
 abstract = {The Centre for Adaptive Behaviour and Cognition (ABC) has hypothesised that much human decision-making can be described by simple algorithmic process models (heuristics). This paper explains this approach and relates it to research in biology on rules of thumb, which we also review. As an example of a simple heuristic, consider the lexicographic strategy of Take The Best for choosing between two alternatives: cues are searched in turn until one discriminates, then search stops and all other cues are ignored. Heuristics consist of building blocks, and building blocks exploit evolved or learned abilities such as recognition memory; it is the complexity of these abilities that allows the heuristics to be simple. Simple heuristics have an advantage in making decisions fast and with little information, and in avoiding overfitting. Furthermore, humans are observed to use simple heuristics. Simulations show that the statistical structures of different environments affect which heuristics perform better, a relationship referred to as ecological rationality. We contrast ecological rationality with the stronger claim of adaptation. Rules of thumb from biology provide clearer examples of adaptation because animals can be studied in the environments in which they evolved. The range of examples is also much more diverse. To investigate them, biologists have sometimes used similar simulation techniques to ABC, but many examples depend on empirically driven approaches. ABC's theoretical framework can be useful in connecting some of these examples, particularly the scattered literature on how information from different cues is integrated. Optimality modelling is usually used to explain less detailed aspects of behaviour but might more often be redirected to investigate rules of thumb.},

  abstract     = {We provide research findings on the physics of aerosol and droplet dispersion relevant to the hypothesized aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic. We utilize physics-based modeling at different levels of complexity, along with previous literature on coronaviruses, to investigate the possibility of airborne transmission. The previous literature, our 0D-3D simulations by various physics-based models, and theoretical calculations, indicate that the typical size range of speech and cough originated droplets (d<=20 mycro m) allows lingering in the air for O(1h) so that they could be inhaled. Consistent with the previous literature, numerical evidence on the rapid drying process of even large droplets, up to sizes O(100 mycro m), into droplet nuclei/aerosols is provided. Based on the literature and the public media sources, we provide evidence that the individuals, who have been tested positive on COVID-19, could have been exposed to aerosols/droplet nuclei by inhaling them in significant numbers e.g. O(100). By 3D scale-resolving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, we give various examples on the transport and dilution of aerosols (d<=20 mycro m) over distances O(10m) in generic environments. We study susceptible and infected individuals in generic public places by Monte-Carlo modelling. The developed model takes into account the locally varying aerosol concentration levels which the susceptible accumulate via inhalation. The introduced concept, "exposure time" to virus containing aerosols is proposed to complement the traditional "safety distance" thinking. We show that the exposure time to inhale O(100) aerosols could range from O(1s) to O(1min) or even to O(1h) depending on the situation. The Monte-Carlo simulations, along with the theory, provide clear quantitative insight to the exposure time in different public indoor environments.},

  abstract     = {Superspreading events have distinguished the COVID-19 pandemic from the early outbreak of the disease. Our studies of exhaled aerosol suggest that a critical factor in these and other transmission events is the propensity of certain individuals to exhale large numbers of small respiratory droplets. Our findings indicate that the capacity of airway lining mucus to resist breakup on breathing varies significantly between individuals, with a trend to increasing with the advance of COVID-19 infection and body mass index multiplied by age (i.e., BMI-years). Understanding the source and variance of respiratory droplet generation, and controlling it via the stabilization of airway lining mucus surfaces, may lead to effective approaches to reducing COVID-19 infection and transmission.COVID-19 transmits by droplets generated from surfaces of airway mucus during processes of respiration within hosts infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. We studied respiratory droplet generation and exhalation in human and nonhuman primate subjects with and without COVID-19 infection to explore whether SARS-CoV-2 infection, and other changes in physiological state, translate into observable evolution of numbers and sizes of exhaled respiratory droplets in healthy and diseased subjects. In our observational cohort study of the exhaled breath particles of 194 healthy human subjects, and in our experimental infection study of eight nonhuman primates infected, by aerosol, with SARS-CoV-2, we found that exhaled aerosol particles vary between subjects by three orders of magnitude, with exhaled respiratory droplet number increasing with degree of COVID-19 infection and elevated BMI-years. We observed that 18\% of human subjects (35) accounted for 80\% of the exhaled bioaerosol of the group (194), reflecting a superspreader distribution of bioaerosol analogous to a classical 20:80 superspreader of infection distribution. These findings suggest that quantitative assessment and control of exhaled aerosol may be critical to slowing the airborne spread of COVID-19 in the absence of an effective and widely disseminated vaccine.All data from this study are presented in the article and SI Appendix.},

  abstract     = {Successful containment strategies for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will depend on reliable diagnostic assays. Point-of-care antigen tests (POCT) may provide an alternative to time-consuming PCR tests to rapidly screen for acute infections on site.
Here, we evaluated two SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests: the STANDARD F COVID-19 Ag FIA (FIA) and the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). For diagnostic assessment, we used a large set of PCR-positive and PCR-negative respiratory swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and health care workers in the setting of two University Hospitals in Munich, Germany, i.e. emergency rooms, patient care units or employee test centers.
For FIA, overall clinical sensitivity and specificity were 45.4\% (n=381) and 97.8\% (n=360), respectively, and for RAT, 50.3\% (n=445) and 97.7\% (n=386), respectively. For primary diagnosis of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, diagnostic sensitivities were 60.9\% (FIA) (n=189) and 64.5\% (RAT) (n=256).
This questions these tests' utility for the reliable detection of acute SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, in particular in high-risk settings. We support the proposal that convincing high-quality outcome data on the impact of false-negative and false-positive antigen test results need to be obtained in a POCT setting. Moreover, the efficacy of alternative testing strategies to complement PCR assays must be evaluated by independent laboratories, prior to widespread implementation in national and international test strategies.},

Here, we provide a national-scale analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) superspreading during the first wave of infections in Austria, a country that played a major role in initial virus transmissions in Europe. Capitalizing on Austria's well-developed epidemiological surveillance system, we identified major SARS-CoV-2 clusters during the first wave of infections and performed deep whole-genome sequencing of more than 500 virus samples. Phylogenetic-epidemiological analysis enabled the reconstruction of superspreading events and charts a map of tourism-related viral spread originating from Austria in spring 2020. Moreover, we exploited epidemiologically well-defined clusters to quantify SARS-CoV-2 mutational dynamics, including the observation of low-frequency mutations that progressed to fixation within the infection chain. Time-resolved virus sequencing unveiled viral mutation dynamics within individuals with COVID-19, and epidemiologically validated infector-infectee pairs enabled us to determine an average transmission bottleneck size of 103 SARS-CoV-2 particles. In conclusion, this study illustrates the power of combining epidemiological analysis with deep viral genome sequencing to unravel the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to gain fundamental insights into mutational dynamics and transmission properties.},

  abstract  = {A SARS-CoV2 super-spreading event occurred during carnival in a small town in Germany. Due to the rapidly imposed lockdown and its relatively closed community, this town was seen as an ideal model to investigate the infection fatality rate (IFR). Here, a 7-day seroepidemiological observational study was performed to collect information and biomaterials from a random, household-based study population. The number of infections was determined by IgG analyses and PCR testing. We found that of the 919 individuals with evaluable infection status, 15.5\% (95\% CI:[12.3\%; 19.0\%]) were infected. This is a fivefold higher rate than the reported cases for this community (3.1\%). 22.2\% of all infected individuals were asymptomatic. The estimated IFR was 0.36\% (95\% CI:[0.29\%; 0.45\%]) for the community and 0.35\% [0.28\%; 0.45\%] when age-standardized to the population of the community. Participation in carnival increased both infection rate (21.3\% versus 9.5\%, p<0.001) and number of symptoms (estimated relative mean increase 1.6, p=0.007). While the infection rate here is not representative for Germany, the IFR is useful to estimate the consequences of the pandemic in places with similar healthcare systems and population characteristics. Whether the super-spreading event not only increases the infection rate but also affects the IFR requires further investigation.},

Although fewer surface swabs (3.1{\%}, n=318) tested positive, medical equipment such as face shield frequently contacted/used by healthcare workers and the work shift floor were contaminated by SARS-CoV-2 (3-8 viruses/cm2). Three of the air samples (n=44) including those collected using a robot-assisted sampler were detected positive by a digital PCR with a concentration level of 9-219 viruses/m3. RT-PCR diagnosis using throat swab specimens had a failure rate of more than 22{\%} in safely discharging COVID-19 patients who were otherwise still exhaling the SARS-CoV-2 by a rate of estimated 1400 RNA copies per minute into the air. Direct surface contact might not represent a major transmission route, and lower positive rate of air sample (6.8{\%}) was likely due to natural ventilation (1.6-3.3 m/s) and regular disinfection practices. While there is a critical need for strengthening hospital discharge standards in preventing re-emergence of COVID-19 spread, use of breath sample as a supplement specimen could further guard the hospital discharge to ensure the safety of the public and minimize the pandemic re-emergence risk.},

  abstract  = {Objectives: Because the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols but failure to isolate viable (infectious)
virus are commonly reported, there is substantial controversy whether severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be transmitted through aerosols. This conundrum occurs
because common air samplers can inactivate virions through their harsh collection processes. We sought
to resolve the question whether viable SARS-CoV-2 can occur in aerosols using VIVAS air samplers that
operate on a gentle water vapor condensation principle.
Methods: Air samples collected in the hospital room of two coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients,
one ready for discharge and the other newly admitted, were subjected to RT-qPCR and virus culture. The
genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 collected from the air and isolated in cell culture were sequenced.
Results: Viable SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from air samples collected 2 to 4.8 m away from the patients. The
genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from the material collected by the air samplers was
identical to that isolated from the newly admitted patient. Estimates of viable viral concentrations ranged
from 6 to 74 TCID50 units/L of air.
Conclusions: Patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 produce aerosols in the absence of
aerosol-generating procedures that contain viable SARS-CoV-2, and these aerosols may serve as a source of
transmission of the virus.},

  abstract     = {Disease transmission is notoriously heterogeneous, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. A skewed distribution where few individuals or events are responsible for the majority of transmission can result in explosive, superspreading events, which produce rapid and volatile epidemic dynamics, especially early or late in epidemics. Anticipating and preventing superspreading events can produce large reductions in overall transmission rates. Here, we present a stochastic compartmental (SEIR) epidemiological model framework for estimating transmission parameters from multiple imperfectly observed data streams, including reported cases, deaths, and mobile phone-based mobility that incorporates individual-level heterogeneity in transmission using previous estimates for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. We parameterize the model for COVID-19 epidemic dynamics by estimating a time-varying transmission rate that incorporates the impact of non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies that change over time, in five epidemiologically distinct settings-Los Angeles and Santa Clara Counties, California; Seattle (King County), Washington; Atlanta (Dekalb and Fulton Counties), Georgia; and Miami (Miami-Dade County), Florida. We find that the effective reproduction number (RE) dropped below 1 rapidly in all five locations following social distancing orders in mid-March, 2020, but that gradually increasing mobility starting around mid-April led to an RE once again above 1 in late May (Los Angeles, Miami, and Atlanta) or early June (Santa Clara County and Seattle). However, we find that increased social distancing starting in mid-July in response to epidemic resurgence once again dropped RE below 1 in all locations by August 14. We next used the fitted model to ask: how does truncating the individual-level transmission rate distribution (which removes periods of time with especially high individual transmission rates and thus models superspreading events) affect epidemic dynamics and control? We find that interventions that truncate the transmission rate distribution while partially relaxing social distancing are broadly effective, with impacts on epidemic growth on par with the strongest population-wide social distancing observed in April, 2020. Given that social distancing interventions will be needed to maintain epidemic control until a vaccine becomes widely available, {\textquotedbl}chopping off the tail{\textquotedbl} to reduce the probability of superspreading events presents a promising option to alleviate the need for extreme general social distancing.},

  abstract  = {On March 17, 2020, a member of a Skagit County, Washington, choir informed Skagit County Public Health (SCPH) that several members of the 122-member choir had become ill. Three persons, two from Skagit County and one from another area, had test results positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Another 25 persons had compatible symptoms. SCPH obtained the choir's member list and began an investigation on March 18. Among 61 persons who attended a March 10 choir practice at which one person was known to be symptomatic, 53 cases were identified, including 33 confirmed and 20 probable cases (secondary attack rates of 53.3{\%} among confirmed cases and 86.7{\%} among all cases). Three of the 53 persons who became ill were hospitalized (5.7{\%}), and two died (3.7{\%}). The 2.5-hour singing practice provided several opportunities for droplet and fomite transmission, including members sitting close to one another, sharing snacks, and stacking chairs at the end of the practice. The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization (1). Certain persons, known as superemitters, who release more aerosol particles during speech than do their peers, might have contributed to this and previously reported COVID-19 superspreading events (2-5). These data demonstrate the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of superemitters contributing to broad transmission in certain unique activities and circumstances. It is recommended that persons avoid face-to-face contact with others, not gather in groups, avoid crowded places, maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet to reduce transmission, and wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.},

  abstract  = {Background: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has now spread to a number of countries worldwide. While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number R0, variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others. Methods: We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution. Results: Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of R0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter k of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95{\%} CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80{\%} of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (10{\%}). A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for R0 and k (95{\%} CrIs: R0 1.4-12; k 0.04-0.2); however, the upper bound of R0 was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution. Conclusions: Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND

Respiratory protective devices are critical in protecting against infection in healthcare workers at high risk of novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19); however, recommendations are conflicting and epidemiological data on their relative effectiveness against COVID-19 are limited.

PURPOSE

To compare medical masks to N95 respirators in preventing laboratory-confirmed viral infection and respiratory illness including coronavirus specifically in healthcare workers.

DATA SOURCES

MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL from January 1, 2014, to March 9, 2020. Update of published search conducted from January 1, 1990, to December 9, 2014.

STUDY SELECTION

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the protective effect of medical masks to N95 respirators in healthcare workers.

DATA EXTRACTION

Reviewer pair independently screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence.

DATA SYNTHESIS

Four RCTs were meta-analyzed adjusting for clustering. Compared with N95 respirators; the use of medical masks did not increase laboratory-confirmed viral (including coronaviruses) respiratory infection (OR 1.06; 95{\%} CI 0.90-1.25; I2 =0{\%}; low certainty in the evidence) or clinical respiratory illness (OR 1.49; 95{\%} CI: 0.98-2.28; I2 =78{\%}; very low certainty in the evidence). Only one trial evaluated coronaviruses separately and found no difference between the two groups (P=.49).

LIMITATIONS

Indirectness and imprecision of available evidence.

CONCLUSIONS

Low certainty evidence suggests that medical masks and N95 respirators offer similar protection against viral respiratory infection including coronavirus in healthcare workers during non-aerosol-generating care. Preservation of N95 respirators for high-risk, aerosol-generating procedures in this pandemic should be considered when in short supply.},

Nonetheless, it has long been known that normal speech also yields large quantities of particles that are too small to see by eye, but are large enough to carry a variety of communicable respiratory pathogens. Here we show that the rate of particle emission during normal human speech is positively correlated with the loudness (amplitude) of vocalization, ranging from approximately 1 to 50 particles per second (0.06 to 3 particles per cm3) for low to high amplitudes, regardless of the language spoken (English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic). Furthermore, a small fraction of individuals behaves as {\textquotedbl}speech superemitters,{\textquotedbl} consistently releasing an order of magnitude more particles than their peers. Our data demonstrate that the phenomenon of speech superemission cannot be fully explained either by the phonic structures or the amplitude of the speech. These results suggest that other unknown physiological factors, varying dramatically among individuals, could affect the probability of respiratory infectious disease transmission, and also help explain the existence of superspreaders who are disproportionately responsible for outbreaks of airborne infectious disease.},

The basic reproduction number, which has been widely used-appropriately and less appropriately-to characterize the transmissibility of the virus, hides the fact that transmission is stochastic, often dominated by a small number of individuals, and heavily influenced by superspreading events (SSEs). The distinct transmission features of SARS-CoV-2, e.g., high stochasticity under low prevalence (as compared to other pathogens, such as influenza), and the central role played by SSEs on transmission dynamics cannot be overlooked. Many explosive SSEs have occurred in indoor settings, stoking the pandemic and shaping its spread, such as long-term care facilities, prisons, meat-packing plants, produce processing facilities, fish factories, cruise ships, family gatherings, parties, and nightclubs. These SSEs demonstrate the urgent need to understand routes of transmission, while posing an opportunity to effectively contain outbreaks with targeted interventions to eliminate SSEs. Here, we describe the different types of SSEs, how they influence transmission, empirical evidence for their role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and give recommendations for control of SARS-CoV-2.},

During the Covid-19 outbreak, a recurrent subject in scientific literature has been brought back into discussion: whether surgical masks provide a sufficient protection against airborne SARS-CoV-2 infections.

OBJECTIVES

The objective of this review is to summarize the available studies which have compared the respective effectiveness of surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirators for the prevention of infections caused by viruses that are transmitted by the respiratory tract.

METHODS

The relevant scientific literature was identified by querying the PubMed database with a combination of search strings. The narrower search string {\textquotedbl}(surgical mask *) AND (respirator OR respirators){\textquotedbl} included all the relevant articles retrieved using broader search strategies. Of all the relevant articles found, seven systematic reviews were selected and examined.

RESULTS

The currently available scientific evidence seems to suggest that surgical masks and N95 respirators/FFP2 confer an equivalent degree of protection against airborne viral infections.

DISCUSSION

Since surgical masks are less expensive than N95 respirators but seem to be as effective in protecting against airborne infection and they are also more comfortable for the user, requiring less respiratory work, they should be the standard protective device for health care workers and especially for workers who carry out non-medical jobs. Filtering facepiece respirators, whose extended use is less comfortable for the wearer, may be preferred for procedures which require greater protection for a shorter time.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND

Spreader and super-spreader are terms that refer to people who have greater potential for disease transmission, to infect other people.

OBJECTIVE

To present scientific evidence regarding the impact of COVID-19 spreaders.

DESIGN AND SETTING

Systematic review of the literature (using the PRISMA framework), performed at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florian{\'o}polis (SC), Brazil.

METHODS

A search for articles was carried out in the SciELO, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus, Bireme and Web of Science databases. A search for gray literature was also conducted via Google Scholar. There was no restriction regarding place or language, and the search covered the period from January 2010 to August 2020. Studies were selected based on a combination of descriptors from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).

RESULTS

Isolated cases of people diagnosed with COVID-19 who were classified as super-spreaders were found. They had been classified thus because they may have had greater potential for infecting other individuals. However, greater numbers of interventions are needed in order to identify and manage COVID-19 cases. There is little evidence regarding this detection, which further hinders recognition and understanding of super-spreading events.

CONCLUSION

The scientific community needs greater depth of evaluation and understanding of how these patients physiologically develop the ability to propagate COVID-19 more intensely. A simpler way of tracking them is also necessary, given that many infected people are asymptomatic. Many patients also have mild symptoms, suggesting that these individuals could also be classified as possible COVID-19 spreaders.PROSPERO Number: ID 217874 (submitted for publication and is being assessed by the editorial team).},

Case reports were extracted from the local Municipal Health Commissions of 320 prefectural municipalities in China (not including Hubei Province). We identified all outbreaks involving three or more cases and reviewed the major characteristics of the enclosed spaces in which the outbreaks were reported and their associated indoor environmental aspects. Three hundred and eighteen outbreaks with three or more cases were identified, comprising a total of 1245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural cities. Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8{\%} involved three cases, 26.4{\%} involved four cases, and only 1.6{\%} involved ten or more cases. Home-based outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9{\%}), followed by transport-based outbreaks (108; 34.0{\%}), and many outbreaks occurred in more than one category of venue. All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in indoor environments, which confirm that sharing indoor spaces with one or more infected persons is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.},

  abstract  = {Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 occurs through exhaled respiratory droplets from infected humans. Currently, however, there is much controversy over whether respiratory aerosol microdroplets play an important role as a route of transmission. By measuring and modeling the dynamics of exhaled respiratory droplets, we can assess the relative contribution of aerosols to the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. We measure size distribution, total numbers, and volumes of respiratory droplets, including aerosols, by speaking and coughing from healthy subjects. Dynamic modeling of exhaled respiratory droplets allows us to account for aerosol persistence times in confined public spaces. The probability of infection by inhalation of aerosols when breathing in the same space can then be estimated using current estimates of viral load and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. The current known reproduction numbers show a lower infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to, for instance, measles, which is known to be efficiently transmitted through the air. In line with this, our study of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that aerosol transmission is a possible but perhaps not a very efficient route, in particular from non-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals that exhibit low viral loads.},

  abstract  = {Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R(0), which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population. Population estimates of R(0) can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous 'superspreading events' in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R(0) is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND {\&} OBJECTIVES

A significant number of reported COVID-19 cases can be traced back to superspreader events (SSEs), where a disproportionally large number of secondary cases relative to the standard reproductive rate, R0, are initiated. Although a superspreader is an individual who undergoes more viral shedding and transmission than others, it appears likely that environmental factors have a substantial role in SSEs. We categorise SSEs into two distinct groups: 'societal' and 'isolated' SSEs.

METHODS

We summarise SSEs that have occurred using multiple databases that have been cross referenced to ensure numbers are as reliable as we can ascertain. This enables more focussed and productive control of the current pandemic and future pandemics, especially as countries and regions ease lockdown restrictions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

'Societal' SSEs pose a significant threat as members of the event are free to mingle and can infect individuals in the outside community. On the other hand, 'isolated' SSEs can be effectively quarantined as only a few individuals can transmit the virus from the isolated community to the outside community, therefore lowering further societal infection.},

National guidelines for non-pharmaceutical interventions focus mainly on the interference with viral transmission via droplets and surface by hygiene measures, limitation of human contact, and social distancing. There is growing evidence that a third route of transmission by aerosols - exhaled tiny particles with viable infectious virus that remain airborne for hours - may be relevant. This route may even be the predominant way of viral transmission in the case of so-called superspreading events. It implies the need for adequate ventilation at indoor spaces without recirculation of virus containing aerosols. Here, the use of face-masks might be of added value too. These measures appear to be especially pivotal during episodes of colder weather, when people spend significantly more time indoors.},

  abstract  = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is pandemic. Prevention and control strategies require an improved understanding of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. We did a rapid review of the literature on SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics with a focus on infective dose. We sought comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We examined laboratory animal and human studies. The literature on infective dose, transmission and routes of exposure was limited specially in humans, and varying endpoints were used for measurement of infection. Despite variability in animal studies, there was some evidence that increased dose at exposure correlated with higher viral load clinically, and severe symptoms. Higher viral load measures did not reflect coronavirus disease 2019 severity. Aerosol transmission seemed to raise the risk of more severe respiratory complications in animals. An accurate quantitative estimate of the infective dose of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is not currently feasible and needs further research. Our review suggests that it is small, perhaps about 100 particles. Further work is also required on the relationship between routes of transmission, infective dose, co-infection and outcomes.},

Abstract = {Cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 200 countries. Thousands of health workers have been infected and outbreaks have occurred in hospitals, aged care facilities and prisons. World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for contact and droplet precautions for Healthcare Workers (HCWs) caring for suspected COVID-19 patients, whilst the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) has recommended airborne precautions. The 1 - 2 m (???3 - 6 ft) rule of spatial separation is central to droplet precautions and assumes large droplets do not travel further than 2 m (???6 ft). We aimed to review the evidence for horizontal distance travelled by droplets and the guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), US Center for Diseases Control (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on respiratory protection for COVID-19. We found that the evidence base for current guidelines is sparse, and the available data do not support the 1 - 2 m (???3 - 6 ft) rule of spatial separation. Of ten studies on horizontal droplet distance, eight showed droplets travel more than 2 m (???6 ft), in some cases more than 8 meters (???26 ft). Several studies of SARS-CoV-2 support aerosol transmission and one study documented virus at a distance of 4 meters (???13 ft) from the patient. Moreover, evidence suggests infections cannot neatly be separated into the dichotomy of droplet versus airborne transmission routes. Available studies also show that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the air, 3 hours after aeroslisation. The weight of combined evidence supports airborne precautions for the occupational health and safety of health workers treating patients with COVID-19.},

  abstract  = {The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children1-4. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. We evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Canada and South Korea. We estimate that susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21\% (95\% credible interval: 12-31\%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69\% (57-82\%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, we find that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. Our age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures-such as many low-income countries-the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.},

  abstract  = {COVID-19 is a novel disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. During the global vaccination rollout, it is vital to thoroughly understand the modes of transmission of the virus in order to prevent further spread of variants and ultimately to end the pandemic. The current literature suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted among the human population primarily through respiratory droplets and, to a lesser extent, via aerosols. Transmission appears to be affected by temperature, humidity, precipitation, air currents, pH, and radiation in the ambient environment. Finally, the use of masks or facial coverings, social distancing, and hand washing are effective public health strategies in reducing the risk of exposure and transmission. Additional research is needed to further characterize the relative benefits of specific nonpharmaceutical interventions.},

  abstract  = {There is ample evidence that masking and social distancing are effective in reducing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. However, due to the complexity of airborne disease transmission, it is difficult to quantify their effectiveness, especially in the case of one-to-one exposure. Here, we introduce the concept of an upper bound for one-to-one exposure to infectious human respiratory particles and apply it to SARS-CoV-2. To calculate exposure and infection risk, we use a comprehensive database on respiratory particle size distribution; exhalation flow physics; leakage from face masks of various types and fits measured on human subjects; consideration of ambient particle shrinkage due to evaporation; and rehydration, inhalability, and deposition in the susceptible airways.We find, for a typical SARS-CoV-2 viral load and infectious dose, that social distancing alone, even at 3.0 m between two speaking individuals, leads to an upper bound of 90\% for risk of infection after a few minutes. If only the susceptible wears a face mask with infectious speaking at a distance of 1.5 m, the upper bound drops very significantly; that is, with a surgical mask, the upper bound reaches 90\% after 30 min, and, with an FFP2 mask, it remains at about 20\% even after 1 h. When both wear a surgical mask, while the infectious is speaking, the very conservative upper bound remains below 30\% after 1 h, but, when both wear a well-fitting FFP2 mask, it is 0.4\%. We conclude that wearing appropriate masks in the community provides excellent protection for others and oneself, and makes social distancing less important.},

Two participants were excluded from per protocol analysis due to seroconversion between screening and inoculation. Eighteen (about53\%) became infected, with viral load (VL) rising steeply and peaking at about 5 days post-inoculation. Virus was first detected in the throat but rose to significantly higher levels in the nose, peaking at about 8.87 log10 copies/ml (median, 95\% CI [8.41,9.53). Viable virus was recoverable from the nose up to $~$10 days post-inoculation, on average. There were no serious adverse events. Mild-to-moderate symptoms were reported by 16 (89\%) infected individuals, beginning 2-4 days post-inoculation. Anosmia/dysosmia developed more gradually in 12 (67\%) participants. No quantitative correlation was noted between VL and symptoms, with high VLs even in asymptomatic infection, followed by the development of serum spike-specific and neutralising antibodies. However, lateral flow results were strongly associated with viable virus and modelling showed that twice-weekly rapid tests could diagnose infection before 70-80\% of viable virus had been generated. Thus, in this first SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, no serious safety signals were detected and the detailed characteristics of early infection and their public health implications were shown.},

  abstract  = {Since its emergence in 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused hundreds of millions of cases and continues to circulate globally. To establish a novel SARS-CoV-2 human challenge model that enables controlled investigation of pathogenesis, correlates of protection and efficacy testing of forthcoming interventions, 36 volunteers aged 18-29 years without evidence of previous infection or vaccination were inoculated with 10 TCID50 of a wild-type virus (SARS-CoV-2/human/GBR/484861/2020) intranasally in an open-label, non-randomized study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04865237; funder, UK Vaccine Taskforce). After inoculation, participants were housed in a high-containment quarantine unit, with 24-hour close medical monitoring and full access to higher-level clinical care. The study's primary objective was to identify an inoculum dose that induced well-tolerated infection in more than 50 percent of participants, with secondary objectives to assess virus and symptom kinetics during infection. All pre-specified primary and secondary objectives were met. Two participants were excluded from the per-protocol analysis owing to seroconversion between screening and inoculation, identified post hoc. Eighteen (approx. 53 percent) participants became infected, with viral load (VL) rising steeply and peaking at  approx. 5 days after inoculation. Virus was first detected in the throat but rose to significantly higher levels in the nose, peaking at approx. 8.87 log10 copies per milliliter (median, 95 percent confidence interval (8.41, 9.53)). Viable virus was recoverable from the nose up to approx. 10 days after inoculation, on average. There were no serious adverse events. Mild-to-moderate symptoms were reported by 16 (89 percent) infected participants, beginning 2-4 days after inoculation, whereas two (11 percent) participants remained asymptomatic (no reportable symptoms). Anosmia or dysosmia developed more slowly in 15 (83 percent) participants. No quantitative correlation was noted between VL and symptoms, with high VLs present even in asymptomatic infection. All infected individuals developed serum spike-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Results from lateral flow tests were strongly associated with viable virus, and modeling showed that twice-weekly rapid antigen tests could diagnose infection before 70-80 percent of viable virus had been generated. Thus, with detailed characterization and safety analysis of this first SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study in young adults, viral kinetics over the course of primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 were established, with implications for public health recommendations and strategies to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Future studies will identify the immune factors associated with protection in those participants who did not develop infection or symptoms and define the effect of prior immunity and viral variation on clinical outcome.},

In the present study, 410 participants were involved in a 2-week intervention relying on prefactual (i.e., "If ... then") messages promoting the purchase of local food. All messages were sent through a research app to participants' mobile phones and were focused on environmental consequences of purchasing (or not purchasing) local food. Four experimental conditions involving messages differing as to outcome sensitivity framing (i.e., gain, non-loss, non-gain and loss) were compared to a control condition. To test the effectiveness of the messages, before and after the 2-week intervention participants were involved in a choice task. They were asked to choose among fruits with different provenience, that is, from the participants' municipality of residence or abroad. Results showed that all message frames increased the selection of local food, compared to control. Furthermore, pro-environmental consumers were more persuaded by messages formulated in terms of gains and non-gains, whereas healthy consumers were more persuaded by messages formulated in terms of losses or non-losses. Discussion focuses on the advantages of tailored communication to promote the purchase of local food.},

title={Interplay between benefit appeal and valence framing in reducing smoking behavior: Evidence from a field experience},
year={2022},
doi={10.1002/bdm.2301},
abstract={Smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable death globally, yet it remains a common behavior. Interventions that increase the concreteness of future smoking outcomes have been suggested to be effective, but little research has examined what type of future outcomes should be highlighted, and in what way. The present study therefore explores the efficacy of two types of framings of smoking cessation consequences: Benefit appeal (time vs. money) and valence (gain vs. loss). A randomized controlled field experiment with 2935 participants conducted via a digital therapeutics app found an interplay between appeal type and valence such that messages focusing on money were most likely to lead to immediate reduced smoking behavior when framed as a gain, rather than loss. Effects on motivation or long-term smoking cessation were not detected. The results shed light on psychological differences between money and time, between attitudes and behaviors, and between short-term and long-term behavior change. This study highlights the importance of considering both benefit appeal and valence framing when designing smoking cessation messages.},

abstract={Mobile technology has facilitated an emerging form of consumption practices called collaborative consumption. In this study, we investigate one such manifestation whereby merchants send group discount coupons to nearby consumers and encourage them to invite surrounding people to enjoy the discount together. We are interested to know if timing (morning vs. afternoon) and message framing (active vs. passive mutual helping tone) would increase the chance of an individual deciding to invite strangers (and invite a higher proportion of strangers if they did) to participate in the collaborative consumption. Facilitating the participation among strangers can help elevate the reach and influence of collaborative consumption, allowing its potential to be better exploited. Our field experiment findings show that in general people are more likely to invite strangers (and also a higher proportion of strangers in all their invitations) in the morning than in the afternoon. In addition, a message framed to ask the focal individual to actively help others enjoy the deal (active tone) is more effective than a message framed passively, i.e., to let others help him/her (passive tone) in the morning. However, passive tone framing can induce individuals to invite a higher proportion of strangers in the afternoon if they did invite others. These findings have important implications to merchants and app providers on how to more fully tap into the potential of collaborative consumption via mobile technology.},

  abstract  = {COVID-19 has shown a high potential of transmission via virus-carrying aerosols as supported by growing evidence. However, detailed investigations that draw direct links between aerosol transport and virus infection are still lacking. To fill in the gap, we conducted a systematic computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based investigation of indoor airflow and the associated aerosol transport in a restaurant setting, where likely cases of airflow-induced infection of COVID-19 caused by asymptomatic individuals were widely reported by the media. We employed an advanced in-house large eddy simulation solver and other cutting-edge numerical methods to resolve complex indoor processes simultaneously, including turbulence, flow-aerosol interplay, thermal effect, and the filtration effect by air conditioners. Using the aerosol exposure index derived from the simulation, we are able to provide a spatial map of the airborne infection risk under different settings. Our results have shown a remarkable direct linkage between regions of high aerosol exposure index and the reported infection patterns in the restaurant, providing strong support to the airborne transmission occurring in this widely reported incident. Using flow structure analysis and reversetime tracing of aerosol trajectories, we are able to further pinpoint the influence of environmental parameters on the infection risks and highlight the need for more effective preventive measures, e.g., placement of shielding according to the local flow patterns. Our research, thus, has demonstrated the capability and value of high-fidelity CFD tools for airborne infection risk assessment and the development of effective preventive measures.},

  abstract  = {Although the interpersonal distance represents an important parameter affecting the risk of infection due to respiratory viruses, the mechanism of exposure to exhaled droplets remains insufficiently characterized. In this study, an integrated risk assessment is presented for SARS-CoV-2 close proximity exposure between a speaking infectious subject and a susceptible subject. It is based on a three-dimensional transient numerical model for the description of exhaled droplet spread once emitted by a speaking person, coupled with a recently proposed SARS-CoV-2 emission approach. Particle image velocimetry measurements were conducted to validate the numerical model. The contribution of the large droplets to the risk is barely noticeable only for distances well below 0.6 m, whereas it drops to zero for greater distances where it depends only on airborne droplets. In particular, for short exposures (10 s) a minimum safety distance of 0.75 m should be maintained to lower the risk below 0.1\%; for exposures of 1 and 15 min this distance increases to about 1.1 and 1.5 m, respectively. Based on the interpersonal distances across countries reported as a function of interacting individuals, cultural differences, and environmental and sociopsychological factors, the approach presented here revealed that, in addition to intimate and personal distances, particular attention must be paid to exposures longer than 1 min within social distances (of about 1 m).},

This study proposes a dilution-based evaluation method for airborne infection risk. The method proposed is benchmarked by the Wells-Riley model and modified Wells-Riley model, which indicates that the method proposed is a thorough expansion of the Wells-Riley model for evaluation of airborne infection risk with both spatial and temporal resolutions. Experiments in a mock hospital ward also demonstrate that the method proposed effectively evaluates the airborne infection risk both spatially and temporally.

  abstract  = {Environmentally mediated infectious disease transmission models provide a mechanistic approach to examining environmental interventions for outbreaks, such as water treatment or surface decontamination. The shift from the classical SIR framework to one incorporating the environment requires codifying the relationship between exposure to environmental pathogens and infection, i.e. the dose-response relationship. Much of the work characterizing the functional forms of dose-response relationships has used statistical fit to experimental data. However, there has been little research examining the consequences of the choice of functional form in the context of transmission dynamics. To this end, we identify four properties of dose-response functions that should be considered when selecting a functional form: low-dose linearity, scalability, concavity, and whether it is a single-hit model. We find that i) middle- and high-dose data do not constrain the low-dose response, and different dose-response forms that are equally plausible given the data can lead to significant differences in simulated outbreak dynamics; ii) the choice of how to aggregate continuous exposure into discrete doses can impact the modeled force of infection; iii) low-dose linear, concave functions allow the basic reproduction number to control global dynamics; and iv) identifiability analysis offers a way to manage multiple sources of uncertainty and leverage environmental monitoring to make inference about infectivity. By applying an environmentally mediated infectious disease model to the 1993 Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak, we demonstrate that environmental monitoring allows for inference regarding the infectivity of the pathogen and thus improves our ability to identify outbreak characteristics such as pathogen strain.},

  abstract  = {Since the first suspected case of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909 deaths have been reported in China up to February 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and internationally. Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90\% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be about 4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be about 3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be about 2.6 based on confirmed cases and about 2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with a lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around 0.15\% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.},

  abstract     = {The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) attracted worldwide attention. It has posed a significant challenge for the global economies, especially the healthcare sector. Even with a robust healthcare system, countries were not prepared for the ramifications of COVID-19. Several statistical, dynamic, and mathematical models of the COVID-19 outbreak including the SEIR model have been developed to analyze the infection its transmission dynamics. The objective of this research is to use public data to study the properties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic to develop a dynamic hybrid model based on SEIRD and ascertainment rate with automatically selected parameters. The proposed model consists of two parts: the modified SEIRD dynamic model and ARIMA models. We fit SEIRD model parameters against historical values of infected, recovered and deceased population divided by ascertainment rate, which, in turn, is also a parameter of the model. Residuals of the first model for infected, recovered, and deceased populations are then corrected using ARIMA models. The model can analyze the input data in real-time and provide long- and short-term forecasts with confidence intervals. The model was tested and validated on the US COVID statistics dataset from the COVID Tracking Project. For validation, we use unseen recent statistical data. We use five common measures to estimate model prediction ability: MAE, MSE, MLSE, Normalized MAE, and Normalized MSE. We proved a great model ability to make accurate predictions of infected, recovered, and deceased patients. The output of the model can be used by the government, private sectors, and policymakers to reduce health and economic risks signi?cantly improved consumer credit scoring.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted controversies and unknowns about how respiratory pathogens spread between hosts. Traditionally, it was thought that respiratory pathogens spread between people through large droplets produced in coughs and through contact with contaminated surfaces (fomites). However, several respiratory pathogens are known to spread through small respiratory aerosols, which can float and travel in air flows, infecting people who inhale them at short and long distances from the infected person. Wang et al. review recent advances in understanding airborne transmission gained from studying the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and other respiratory pathogens. The authors suggest that airborne transmission may be the dominant form of transmission for several respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, and that further understanding of the mechanisms underlying infection from the airborne route will better inform mitigation measures. - GKA A Review discusses the scientific basis of and factors controlling airborne transmission of respiratory viruses including coronavirus. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of and a need to update the traditional view of transmission pathways for respiratory viruses. The long-standing definitions of droplet and airborne transmission do not account for the mechanisms by which virus-laden respiratory droplets and aerosols travel through the air and lead to infection. In this Review, we discuss current evidence regarding the transmission of respiratory viruses by aerosols-how they are generated, transported, and deposited, as well as the factors affecting the relative contributions of droplet-spray deposition versus aerosol inhalation as modes of transmission. Improved understanding of aerosol transmission brought about by studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection requires a reevaluation of the major transmission pathways for other respiratory viruses, which will allow better-informed controls to reduce airborne transmission.},

  abstract  = {Aerosol inhalation is increasingly well recognized as a major if not primary mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-21. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, three highly transmissible lineages evolved and became globally dominant. One hypothesis to explain increased transmissibility is that natural selection favours variants with higher rates of viral aerosol shedding. However, the extent of aerosol shedding of successive SARS-CoV-2 variants is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that viral shedding (measured as RNA copies) into exhaled breath aerosol was significantly greater during infections with Alpha, Delta, and Omicron than with ancestral strains and variants not associated with increased transmissibility. The three highly transmissible variants independently evolved a high viral aerosol shedding phenotype, demonstrating convergent evolution. We did not observe statistically significant differences in rates of shedding between Alpha, Delta, and Omicron infections. The highest shedder in our study, however, had an Omicron infection and shed three orders of magnitude more viral RNA copies than the maximum observed for Delta and Alpha. Our results also show that fully vaccinated and boosted individuals, when infected, can shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 via exhaled breath aerosols. These findings provide additional evidence that inhalation of infectious aerosols is the dominant mode of transmission and emphasize the importance of ventilation, filtration, and air disinfection to mitigate the pandemic and protect vulnerable populations. We anticipate that monitoring aerosol shedding from new SARS-CoV-2 variants and emerging pathogens will be an important component of future threat assessments and will help guide interventions to prevent transmission via inhalation exposure.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Infection risk assessment is very useful in understanding the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and in predicting the risk of these diseases to the public. Quantitative infection risk assessment can provide quantitative analysis of disease transmission and the effectiveness of infection control measures. The Wells-Riley model has been extensively used for quantitative infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases in indoor premises. Some newer studies have also proposed the use of dose-response models for such purpose. This study reviews and compares these two approaches to infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases. The Wells-Riley model allows quick assessment and does not require interspecies extrapolation of infectivity. Dose-response models can consider other disease transmission routes in addition to airborne route and can calculate the infectious source strength of an outbreak in terms of the quantity of the pathogen rather than a hypothetical unit. Spatial distribution of airborne pathogens is one of the most important factors in infection risk assessment of respiratory disease. Respiratory deposition of aerosol induces heterogeneous infectivity of intake pathogens and randomness on the intake dose, which are not being well accounted for in current risk models. Some suggestions for further development of the risk assessment models are proposed.},

Massbalance and dose-response models determine far-eld transmission risks for an individual person and a population of people after sub-dividing a large reference space into 10 identical comparator spaces. For a single infected person, the dose received by an individual person in the comparator space is 10-times higher because the equivalent ventilation rate per infected person is lower when the per capita ventilation rate is preserved.},

abstract={Research from crowd psychology and pedestrian dynamics can inform one another to improve understandings and predictions of collective behaviour. In this chapter, we provide an overview of theoretical insights from crowd psychology on intragroup and intergroup behaviour and discuss possible avenues for implementing principles of the social identity approach into pedestrian models. Specifically, we debate the use of outdated assumptions of crowd behaviour, discuss how the core tenets of social identity theory and self-categorisation theory are central to understanding collective behaviour, showcase how perceptions and experiences of crowd members can be dynamic and influence their perceived safety and behaviour, and then point to recent trends in using crowd psychology to inform models of pedestrian movement and behaviour in emergencies. Finally, we examine barriers to incorporating social psychological theory into models, and look ahead to potential collaborative projects to improve crowd safety and experiences.},

Since it became evident that individuals' reasoning about politics relies heavily not on single facts and details but on frames, two loosely separable strands of investigation emerged. First, detecting the frames that give rise to political attitudes; second, investigating the ways in which issue framings in communicative settings impact such attitudes - such as find in media accounts. Research on framing is conducted in the social and cognitive sciences across a number of disciplines, and has been applied in the public sphere and to media discourses to understand their implications and consequences.},

The conventional diffusion-limited evaporation is not valid to model the evaporation of small size (microm-nanom) droplets since it predicts drying time on the order of milliseconds. Also, the sedimentation timescale of desiccated droplets is on the order of days and overpredicts the virus survival time; hence, it does not corroborate with the above-mentioned titer-decay timescale. We attribute the virus survival timescale to the fact that the drying of small (microm-nanom) droplets is governed, in principle, by the excess internal pressure within the droplet, which stems from the disjoining pressure due to the cohesive intermolecular interaction between the liquid molecules and the Laplace-pressure. The model predictions for the temporal reduction in the aerosolized droplet number density agree well with the temporal decay of virus titer. The findings, therefore, provide insight on the survival of coronavirus in aerosols, which is particularly important to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 from indoors.},

  abstract     = {Objectives
The relative importance of airborne, droplet and contact transmission of influenza A virus and the efficiency of control measures depends among other factors on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media.
Methods
We systematically review available information on the environmental inactivation of influenza A viruses and employ information on infectious dose and results from mathematical models to assess transmission modes.
Results
Daily inactivation rate constants differ by several orders of magnitude: on inanimate surfaces and in aerosols daily inactivation rates are in the order of 1-100, on hands in the order of 1000. Influenza virus can survive in aerosols for several hours, on hands for a few minutes. Nasal infectious dose of influenza A is several orders of magnitude larger than airborne infectious dose.
Conclusions
The airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments. The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed. Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands and is more so than airborne transmission dependent on behavioral parameters. However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode.},

  abstract     = {An essential starting point when investigating the potential role of human expired aerosols in the transmission of disease is to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the expired aerosol generation process, including the aerosol size distribution, the various droplet production mechanisms involved and the corresponding sites of production within the respiratory tract. In order to approach this level of understanding we have integrated the results of two different investigative techniques spanning 3 decades of particle size from 700nm to 1mm, presenting a single composite size distribution, and identifying the most prominent modes in that distribution. We link these modes to specific sites of origin and mechanisms of production. The data for this were obtained using the Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) covering the range 0.7<=d<=20microm and Droplet Deposition Analysis (DDA) covering the range d>=20microm. In the case of speech three distinct droplet size distribution modes were identified with count median diameters at 1.6, 2.5 and 145microm. In the case of voluntary coughing the modes were located at 1.6, 1.7 and 123microm. The modes are associated with three distinct processes: one occurring deep in the lower respiratory tract, another in the region of the larynx and a third in the upper respiratory tract including the oral cavity. The first of these, the Bronchiolar Fluid Film Burst (BFFB or B) mode contains droplets produced during normal breathing. The second, the Laryngeal (L) mode is most active during voicing and coughing. The third, the Oral (O) cavity mode is active during speech and coughing. The number of droplets and the volume of aerosol material associated with each mode of aerosol production during speech and coughing is presented. The size distribution is modeled as a tri-modal lognormal distribution dubbed the Bronchiolar/Laryngeal/Oral (B.L.O.) tri-modal model.},

  abstract  = {The current revival of the American economy is being predicated on social distancing, specifically the Six-Foot Rule, a guideline that offers little protection from pathogen-bearing aerosol droplets sufficiently small to be continuously mixed through an indoor space. The importance of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized. While tools for risk assessment have recently been developed, no safety guideline has been proposed to protect against it. We here build on models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive an indoor safety guideline that would impose an upper bound on the "cumulative exposure time," the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space. We demonstrate how this bound depends on the rates of ventilation and air filtration, dimensions of the room, breathing rate, respiratory activity and face mask use of its occupants, and infectiousness of the respiratory aerosols. By synthesizing available data from the best-characterized indoor spreading events with respiratory drop size distributions, we estimate an infectious dose on the order of 10 aerosol-borne virions. The new virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [{SARS-CoV-2}]) is thus inferred to be an order of magnitude more infectious than its forerunner ({SARS-CoV}), consistent with the pandemic status achieved by {COVID}-19. Case studies are presented for classrooms and nursing homes, and a spreadsheet and online app are provided to facilitate use of our guideline. Implications for contact tracing and quarantining are considered, and appropriate caveats enumerated. Particular consideration is given to respiratory jets, which may substantially elevate risk when face masks are not worn.},

The mean 6MWD and DW values were 593+-57 and 638+-44m (P<0.01) and 35,030+-5306 and 48,882+-6555 kgm (P<0.01), respectively for women and for men. While walking, SpO2 remained unaltered and subjects reached 67+-10\% of their maximal predicted heart rate and a RR mean value of 197+-4 bpm. VAS ratings were significantly higher in females as compared to males (24+-15 vs. 18+-5 mm, P<0.05), however, when corrected for PR change while walking, they were not different. The equation by stepwise multiple regression analysis included height, age and gender for the 6MWD and accounted for 42\% of the total variance. This study confirms the relevant effect of anthropometrics on walking capacity and suggests that when rating dyspnea, the change in heart rate during walking should be considered.},

During physical activity, rate and depth of breathing increase because working muscles need extra oxygen in order to produce more energy. The purpose of this study is to investigate the breathing pattern of healthy human in response to different levels of physical activity measured by distance and duration. Spirometric measurement of breathing parameters of five male participants at rest (sitting and standing) and response to different levels of physical activity (walking, jogging and running) was performed. Using the spirometry data, mathematical models were developed to describe the resulting breathing patterns. The data and the model were used for the analysis of breathing patterns. There was small variation of corresponding breathing parameters for a subject during sitting and standing at rest. Increasing the level of physical activity raised the respiratory characteristic such as tidal volume, breathing frequency and flow rate. The average and peak inspiratory and expiratory flow rates were obtained for the five breathing conditions. The peak inspiratory air flow rate in response to running was 3.4 times that of walking. It was 3.7 times for expiration. Breathing patterns of any two individuals are different. The human breathing is highly affected by the level of physical activity we are doing. The study can help to create awareness regarding breathing pattern related to physical activity and to choose appropriate physical activity.},

Ventilation measurements and peak inspiratory airflows were recorded at each work rate for a two-minute period using an automated gas analysis system. Average ventilation results were consistent with previous research findings during equivalent workloads. As workload increased from moderate to heavy exercise the ratios of maximum and mean peak inspiratory airflow-to-minute ventilation decreased.

With given variables (i.e., velocity, duration, particle size and number of particles, and ambient conditions), the standoff safe distance during coughing, talking, and breathing should be the distance where virus-laden droplets and aerosols do not have significant transmission to another person. However, at a critical distance, the aerosol cloud flux can still be extremely high, which can immediately raise the transmission in a localized area to another person during a static condition. In this study, computational fluid dynamics analysis of selective respiratory actions has been carried out to investigate the effect of the standoff distance and assess the importance of social distancing in indoor places. The prediction of the aerosol transport due to flow generated from coughing, talking, and breathing was obtained by applying the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. From the simulation results, it can be concluded that the aerosols released due to continuous talking travel a similar distance to that released due to sudden coughing. On the other hand, aerosols exhaled from breathing do not travel a long distance but float in air for a long time.},

Methods: A literature search showed that there is a strong scientific rationale and evidence that viruses are very
efficiently spread through aerosols by the patient's breathing only. It is not necessary for the patient to cough or sneeze.
Results: The exhaled aerosol particles are generated by normal breathing in the deep lung through reopening of
collapsed small airways during inspiration. These mucus/surfactant aerosols (size range between 0.2 and
0.6 microm) can transport viruses out of the lungs of patients and be present in the room air for hours.
Conclusion: These aerosol particles are difficult to filter out of the air; because of their physical properties, new
strategies must be developed to protect people from these virus aerosols.},

Mathematical descriptions and assumptions on which these models have been based are discussed. Input data used in previous simulation studies to assess the dispersion of COVID-19 are extracted and reported. Moreover, measurements performed to study the COVID-19 airborne transmission within indoor environments are introduced to support validations for anticipated future modeling studies. Transmission mitigation strategies recommended in recent studies have been classified to include modifying occupancy and ventilation operations, using filters and air purifiers, installing ultraviolet (UV) air disinfection systems, and personal protection compliance, such as wearing masks and social distancing. The application of mitigation strategies to various building types, such as educational, office, public, residential, and hospital, is reviewed. Recommendations for future works are also discussed based on the current apparent knowledge gaps covering both modeling and mitigation approaches. Our findings show that different transmission mitigation measures were recommended for various indoor environments; however, there is no conclusive work reporting their combined effects on the level of mitigation that may be achieved. Moreover, further studies should be conducted to understand better the balance between approaches to mitigating the viral transmissions in buildings and building energy consumption.},

We analyzed a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak involving three families in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, assessed the possibility of airborne transmission, and characterized the associated environmental conditions. We collected epidemiological data, obtained a full video recording and seating records from the restaurant, and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the index case. Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets. We compared the in-room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer. The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer gas concentration decay method. This outbreak involved ten infected persons in three families (A, B, C). All ten persons ate lunch at three neighboring tables at the same restaurant on January 24, 2020. None of the restaurant staff or the 68 patrons at the other 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the measured ventilation rate was 0.9 \frac{L}{s} per person. No close contact or fomite contact was identified, aside from back-to-back sitting in some cases. Analysis of the airflow dynamics indicates that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of long-range transmission of exhaled virus-laden aerosols. Airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is possible in crowded space with a ventilation rate of 1 \frac{L}{s} per person.},

  abstract     = {Background Superspreading events are important drivers of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and long-range (LR) transmission is believed to play a major role. We investigated two choir outbreaks with different attack rates (AR) to analyze the contribution of LR transmission and highlight important measures for prevention.
Methods
We conducted two retrospective cohort studies and obtained demographic, clinical, laboratory and contact data, performed SARS-CoV-2 serology, whole genome sequencing (WGS), calculated LR transmission probabilities, measured particle emissions of selected choir members, and calculated particle air concentrations and inhalation doses.
Results
We included 65 (84\%) and 42 (100\%) members of choirs 1 and 2, respectively, of whom 58 (89\%) and 10 (24\%) became cases. WGS confirmed strain identity in both choirs. Both primary cases transmitted presymptomatically. Particle emission rate when singing was 7 times higher compared to talking. In choir 1, the median concentration of primary cases' emitted particles in the room was estimated to be 8 times higher, exposure at least 30 minutes longer and room volume smaller than in choir 2, resulting in markedly different estimated probabilities for LR transmission (mode: 90\% vs. 16\%, 95\% CI: 80-95\% vs. 6-36\%). According to a risk model, the first transmission in choir 1 occurred likely after 8 minutes of singing.
Conclusions
The attack rate of the two choirs differed significantly reflecting the differences in LR transmission risks. The pooled proportion of cases due to LR transmission was substantial (81\%; 55 of 68 cases) and was facilitated by likely highly infectious primary cases, high particle emission rates, and indoor rehearsing for an extended time. Even in large rooms, singing of an infectious person may lead to secondary infections through LR exposure within minutes. In the context of indoor gatherings without mask-wearing and waning or insufficient immunity, these results highlight the ongoing importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions wherever aerosols can accumulate.},

Several authors have argued that the airborne transmission route of the virus SARS-CoV-2 plays a major role, particularly in poorly ventilated indoor environments. In this paper, the airflow inside a naturally ventilated elementary school classroom is simulated through highly resolved Large Eddy Simulation for a wintertime scenario. The flow results are qualitatively analyzed and the contagion risk is estimated through passive tracers, by coupling the simulation with the traditional Wells-Riley approach. Different window configurations and infected positions are considered. The developed numerical framework is able to capture the dynamics of the phenomenon, highlighting the importance of the spatial inhomogeneities.},

The goal of ESID is to provide a platform for rapid assessment of the most effective interventions for infectious disease control. ESID provides spatial-temporal analysis, forecasting, comparison of simulations, interactive filters, and accessibility options. In its current form, it shows the simulations of a hybrid graph-equation-based model as introduced in for infection control.

On the other hand, the potential airborne transmission of SARS-COV-2 via air can deeply undermine the effectiveness of countermeasures against spreading the disease. Therefore, there is an intense focus to look for ways to mitigate the COVID-19 spread within various indoor settings. This work systematically reviewed articles regarding airborne transmission of SARS-COV2 in various indoor settings since the onset of the pandemic. The systematic search was performed in Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases and has returned 19 original articles carefully screened with regard to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results showed that the facilities, such as dormitories and classrooms, received the most attention followed by office buildings, healthcare facilities, residential buildings, and other potential enclosed spaces such as a metro wagon. Besides, the majority of the studies were conducted experimentally while other studies were done using computer simulations. United States (n=5), Spain (n=4) and China (n=3) were the top three countries based on the number of performed research. Ventilation rate was the most influential parameter in controlling the infection spread. CO2 was the primary reference for viral spread in the buildings. The use of natural ventilation or a combination of mechanical and natural ventilations was found to be highly effective in the studies. The current work helps in furthering research on effective interventions to improve indoor air quality and control the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases.},

The article begins by investigating the implicit customs of physical waiting in line, uncovering the surprisingly complex unwritten rules (and exceptions) that give queues stability even in the absence of legal governance or state enforcement. Yet the prevailing norms literature typically explains informal order by reference to close-knit groups that can impose sanctions on violators of extralegal rules. This raises a puzzle: Why do queue norms repeatedly produce informal, yet reliable, order among total strangers unlikely to interact again? This article answers this question by looking to social-psychological research showing that people tend to be strong reciprocators rather than selfish utility maximizers. This model makes sense of both our tendency to defer to line norms as well as the disproportionate sanctions with which defectors from these norms meet.},

  abstract = {Mass gatherings pose a set of serious health risks to attendees. Yet, the risks at mass gatherings have not been systematically reviewed and categorised, and there has been a lack of research on the role of social norms in shaping risks. This systematic review aimed to identify the types of risks and their prevalence at each type of mass gathering and to evaluate whether social norms are considered in the mass gatherings literature. We conducted our review following the PRISMA checklist and searched the literature comprehensively in May 2021 via six electronic databases: MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, and CINAHL Plus. Articles were included if they met our inclusion criteria in the five domains: population, mass gatherings, risks, methods, and studies characteristics. The review included 183 articles about more than 83 mass gatherings in 42 countries. There were four types of planned mass gatherings: religious, sporting, music festivals, and other/cultural festivals, and four main types of risks: health, behavioural, environmental, and other/mental health risks. Social norms were mentioned in 5 articles. This is the first comprehensive systematic review of the literature regarding risks at mass gatherings with a specific focus on the role of social norms in shaping risks. Each mass gathering poses different types of risks depending on the nature of the event, and social norms can partially explain this. However, social norms are minimally considered in the literature and further studies about the role of identity-related norms in shaping risks at mass gatherings are needed.},

  abstract  = {Indoor airflow patterns and the spreading of respiratory air were studied using the large-eddy simulation (LES) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. A large model room with mixing ventilation was investigated. The model setup was motivated by super-spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with a particular focus on a known choir practice setup where one singer infected all the other choir members. The room was heated with radiators at two opposite walls in the cold winter time. The singers produced further heat generating buoyancy in the room. The Reynolds number of the inflow air jets was set to Re=2750, corresponding to an air-changes-per-hour (ACH) value of approximately 3.5. The CFD solver was first validated after which a thorough grid convergence study was performed for the full numerical model room with heat sources. The simulations were then executed over a time of t=20 min to account for slightly more than one air change timescale for three model cases: (1) full setup with heat sources (radiators+singers) in the winter scenario, (2) setup without radiators in a summer scenario, and (3) theoretical setup without buoyancy (uniform temperature). The main findings of the paper are as follows. First, the buoyant flow structures were noted to be significant. This was observed by comparing cases 1,2 with case 3. Second, the dispersion of the respiratory aerosol concentration, modeled as a passive scalar, was noted to be significantly affected by the buoyant flow structures in cases 1-2. In particular, the aerosol cloud was noted to either span the whole room (cases 1-2) or accumulate in the vicinity of the infected singer (case 3). Turbulence was clearly promoted by the interaction of the upward/downward moving warmer/cooler air currents which significantly affected the dispersion of the respiratory aerosols in the room. The study highlights the benefits of high-resolution, unsteady airflow modeling (e.g. LES) for interior design which may consequently also impact predictions on exposure to potentially infectious respiratory aerosols.},

This review paper intends to outline the literature concerning the transmission of virus-laden droplets and aerosols in different environmental settings and demonstrates the behavior of droplets and aerosols resulted from a coughjet of an infected person in various confined spaces. The case studies that have come out in different countries have, with prima facie evidence, manifested that the airborne transmission plays a profound role in contracting susceptible hosts. The infection propensities in confined spaces (airplane, passenger car, and healthcare center) by the transmission of droplets and aerosols under varying ventilation conditions were discussed. Interestingly, the nosocomial transmission by airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus-laden aerosols in healthcare facilities may be plausible. Hence, clearly defined, science-based administrative, clinical, and physical measures are of paramount importance to eradicate the COVID-19 pandemic from the world.},

  abstract  = {A large number of infectious diseases are believed to be transmitted between people via large droplets and by airborne routes. An understanding of evaporation and dispersion of droplets and droplet nuclei is not only significant for developing effective engineering control methods for infectious diseases but also for exploring the basic transmission mechanisms of the infectious diseases. How far droplets can move is related to how far droplet-borne diseases can transmit. A simple physical model is developed and used here to investigate the evaporation and movement of droplets expelled during respiratory activities; in particular, the well-known Wells evaporation-falling curve of droplets is revis ited considering the effect of relative humidity, air speed, and respiratory jets. Our simple model considers the movement of exhaled air, as well as the evaporation and movement of a single droplet. Exhaled air is treated as a steady-state non-isothermal (warm) jet horizontally issuing into stagnant surrounding air. A droplet is assumed to evaporate and move in this non-isothermal jet. Calculations are performed for both pure water droplets and droplets of sodium chloride (physiological saline) solution (0.9 percent w/v). We calculate the droplet lifetimes and how droplet size changes, as well as how far the droplets travel in different relative humidities. Our results indicate that a droplet's size predominately dictates its evaporation and movement after being expelled. The sizes of the largest droplets that would totally evaporate before falling 2 m away are determined under different conditions. The maximum horizontal distances that droplets can reach during different respiratory activities are also obtained. Our study is useful for developing effective prevention measures for controlling infectious diseases in hospitals and in the community at large.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted by droplets or aerosols has been highly controversial. We sought to explain this controversy through a historical analysis of transmission research in other diseases. For most of human history, the dominant paradigm was that many diseases were carried by the air, often over long distances and in a phantasmagorical way. This miasmatic paradigm was challenged in the mid to late 19th century with the rise of germ theory, and as diseases such as cholera, puerperal fever, and malaria were found to actually transmit in other ways. Motivated by his views on the importance of contact or droplet infection, and the resistance he encountered from the remaining influence of miasma theory, prominent public health official Charles Chapin in 1910 helped initiate a successful paradigm shift, deeming airborne transmission most unlikely. This new paradigm became dominant. However, the lack of understanding of aerosols led to systematic errors in the interpretation of research evidence on transmission pathways. For the next five decades, airborne transmission was considered of negligible or minor importance for all major respiratory diseases, until a demonstration of airborne transmission of tuberculosis (which had been mistakenly thought to be transmitted by droplets) in 1962. The contact or droplet paradigm remained dominant, and only a few diseases were widely accepted as airborne before COVID-19: those that were clearly transmitted to people not in the same room. The acceleration of interdisciplinary research inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that airborne transmission is a major mode of transmission for this disease, and is likely to be significant for many respiratory infectious diseases.},

  abstract     = {The risk assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic were primarily based on dose-response models derived from the pooled datasets for infection of animals susceptible to SARS-CoV. Despite similarities, differences in susceptibility between animals and humans exist for respiratory viruses. The two most commonly used dose-response models for calculating the infection risk of respiratory viruses are the exponential and the Stirling approximated beta-Poisson (BP) models. The modified version of the one-parameter exponential model or the Wells-Riley model was almost solely used for infection risk assessments during the pandemic. Still, the two-parameter (alpha and beta) Stirling approximated BP model is often recommended compared to the exponential dose-response model due to its flexibility. However, the Stirling approximation restricts this model to the general rules of beta >> 1 and alpha << beta, and these conditions are very often violated. To refrain from these requirements, we tested a novel BP model by using the Laplace approximation of the Kummer hypergeometric function instead of the conservative Stirling approximation. The datasets of human respiratory airborne viruses available in the literature for human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and human rhinovirus (HRV-16 and HRV-39) are used to compare the four dose-response models. Based on goodness-of-fit criteria, the exponential model was the best fitting model for the HCoV-229E (k = 0.054) and for HRV-39 datasets (k = 1.0), whereas the Laplace approximated BP model followed by the exact and Stirling approximated BP models are preferred for both the HRV-16 (alpha = 0.152 and beta = 0.021 for Laplace BP) and the HRV-16 and HRV-39 pooled datasets (alpha = 0.2247 and beta = 0.0215 for Laplace BP).},

  abstract  = {Airborne transmission is a recognized pathway of contagion; however, it is rarely quantitatively evaluated. The numerous outbreaks that have occurred during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are putting a demand on researchers to develop approaches capable of both predicting contagion in closed environments (predictive assessment) and analyzing previous infections (retrospective assessment). This study presents a novel approach for quantitative assessment of the individual infection risk of susceptible subjects exposed in indoor microenvironments in the presence of an asymptomatic infected SARS-CoV-2 subject. The application of a Monte Carlo method allowed the risk for an exposed healthy subject to be evaluated or, starting from an acceptable risk, the maximum exposure time. We applied the proposed approach to four distinct scenarios for a prospective assessment, highlighting that, in order to guarantee an acceptable risk of 10-3 for exposed subjects in naturally ventilated indoor environments, the exposure time could be well below one hour. Such maximum exposure time clearly depends on the viral load emission of the infected subject and on the exposure conditions; thus, longer exposure times were estimated for mechanically ventilated indoor environments and lower viral load emissions. The proposed approach was used for retrospective assessment of documented outbreaks in a restaurant in Guangzhou (China) and at a choir rehearsal in Mount Vernon (USA), showing that, in both cases, the high attack rate values can be justified only assuming the airborne transmission as the main route of contagion. Moreover, we show that such outbreaks are not caused by the rare presence of a superspreader, but can be likely explained by the co-existence of conditions, including emission and exposure parameters, leading to a highly probable event, which can be defined as a 'superspreading event'.},

  abstract     = {The present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic. The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2 host location isolate date. While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This will improve our understanding of virus-host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.},

  abstract     = {Superspreaders are critical infectious resources in multiple infectious diseases. They can be asymptomatic or present mild symptoms but can transmit pathogens to susceptible populations, leading to severe symptoms, and even death. Early identification of this population is extremely important to inhibit the spread of infectious diseases. Right now, the whole global world is suffering from a devastating infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this article, a superspreader cluster event in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified by tracking contacting histories of infected patients. This cluster was found to be originated from an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carrier, which resulted in 13 secondary cases getting infected. All the secondary patients presented with non-typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, dry cough, and myalgia, one of which died of respiratory failure at the end. From this cluster, we learn that people with older ages, low immunity, multiple underlying diseases, especially pulmonary diseases, can contribute to a poor prognosis. Thus, asymptomatic superspreaders of COVID-19 can be extremely dangerous and must be handled time-efficiently.},

The economic burden and health threats caused by these coronaviruses are extremely dreadful and getting more serious as the increasing number of global infections and attributed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Unfortunately, specific medical countermeasures for these hCoVs remain absent. Moreover, the fast spread of misinformation about the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic uniquely places the virus alongside an annoying infodemic and causes unnecessary worldwide panic. SARS-CoV-2 shares many similarities with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, certainly, obvious differences exist as well. Lessons learnt from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, timely updated information of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, and summarized specific knowledge of these hCoVs are extremely invaluable for effectively and efficiently contain the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. By gaining a deeper understanding of hCoVs and the illnesses caused by them, we can bridge knowledge gaps, provide cultural weapons for fighting and controling the spread of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and prepare effective and robust defense lines against hCoVs that may emerge or reemerge in the future. To this end, the state-of-the-art knowledge and comparing the biological features of these lethal hCoVs and the clinical characteristics of illnesses caused by them are systematically summarized in the review.},

The continuous evolution of coronaviruses was further highlighted with the emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012. Currently, the world is concerned about the 2019 novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) that was initially identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Patients presented with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness. The number of cases has been mounting since then. As of late February 2020, tens of thousands of cases and several thousand deaths have been reported in China alone, in addition to thousands of cases in other countries. Although the fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is currently lower than SARS-CoV, the virus seems to be highly contagious based on the number of infected cases to date. In this review, we discuss structure, genome organization, entry of CoVs into target cells, and provide insights into past and present outbreaks. The future of human CoV outbreaks will not only depend on how the viruses will evolve, but will also depend on how we develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies to deal with this continuous threat.},

We estimate that each infected person carries 109 to 1011 virions during peak infection, with a total mass in the range of 1 microg to 100 microg, which curiously implies that all SARS-CoV-2 virions currently circulating within human hosts have a collective mass of only 0.1 kg to 10 kg. We combine our estimates with the available literature on host immune response and viral mutation rates to demonstrate how antibodies markedly outnumber the spike proteins, and the genetic diversity of virions in an infected host covers all possible single nucleotide substitutions.},

In humans, host characteristics, including age, sex, comorbidities, smoking, and pregnancy, are associated with severe COVID-19. Similarly, in animals, host factors are strong determinants of disease severity, although most animal infection models manifest clinically with mild to moderate respiratory disease. The influence of variants of concern as it relates to infectious dose, consequence of overall pathogenicity, and disease outcome in dose-response remains unknown. Epidemiologic data suggest a dose-response relationship for infection contrasting with limited and inconsistent surrogate-based evidence between dose and disease severity. Recommendations include the design of future infection studies in animal models to investigate inoculating dose on outcomes and the use of better proxies for dose in human epidemiology studies.},

  abstract  = {Aerosol inhalation is recognized as the dominant mode of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. Three highly transmissible lineages evolved during the pandemic. One hypothesis to explain increased transmissibility is that natural selection favors variants with higher rates of viral aerosol shedding. However, the extent of aerosol shedding of successive SARS-CoV-2 variants is unknown. We aimed to measure the infectivity and rate of SARS-CoV-2 shedding into exhaled breath aerosol (EBA) by individuals during the Delta and Omicron waves and compared those rates with those of prior SARS-CoV-2 variants from our previously published work.Individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (n = 93; 32 vaccinated and 20 boosted) were recruited to give samples, including 30-minute breath samples into a Gesundheit-II EBA sampler. Samples were quantified for viral RNA using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and cultured for virus. Alpha (n = 4), Delta (n = 3), and Omicron (n = 29) cases shed significantly more viral RNA copies into EBAs than cases infected with ancestral strains and variants not associated with increased transmissibility (n = 57). All Delta and Omicron cases were fully vaccinated and most Omicron cases were boosted. We cultured virus from the EBA of 1 boosted and 3 fully vaccinated cases. Alpha, Delta, and Omicron independently evolved high viral aerosol shedding phenotypes, demonstrating convergent evolution. Vaccinated and boosted cases can shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 via EBA. These findings support a dominant role of infectious aerosols in transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Monitoring aerosol shedding from new variants and emerging pathogens can be an important component of future threat assessments and guide interventions to prevent transmission.},

There would be many benefits from doing so, including a better assessment of respiratory health, a basis for more precise delivery of pharmaceutical drugs for treatment, and the understanding and potential minimization of respiratory infection transmission. We review the physics of particle generation in the respiratory tract, the fate of these particles in the air on exhalation and the physics of particle inhalation. The main focus is on evidence from experimental studies. We conclude that although there is qualitative understanding of the generation of particles in the respiratory tract, a basic quantitative knowledge of the characteristics of the particles emitted during respiratory activities and their fate after emission, and a theoretical understanding of particle deposition during inhalation, nevertheless the general understanding of the entire process is rudimentary, and many open questions remain.},

We quantified and sequenced viral RNA, cultured virus, and assayed serum samples for anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibodies.We enrolled 49 seronegative cases (mean days post onset 3.8 plus minus 2.1), May 2020 through April 2021. We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 36 percent of fine (leq 5 microm), 26 percent of coarse (geq 5 microm) aerosols, and 52 percent of fomite samples overall and in all samples from 4 alpha variant cases. Masks reduced viral RNA by 48 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 3 to 72 percent) in fine and by 77 percent (95 percent CI, 51 to 89 percent) in coarse aerosols; cloth and surgical masks were not significantly different. The alpha variant was associated with a 43-fold (95 percent CI, 6.6- to 280-fold) increase in fine aerosol viral RNA, compared with earlier viruses, that remained a significant 18-fold (95 percent CI, 3.4- to 92-fold) increase adjusting for viral RNA in saliva, swabs, and other potential confounders. Two fine aerosol samples, collected while participants wore masks, were culture-positive.SARS-CoV-2 is evolving toward more efficient aerosol generation and loose-fitting masks provide significant but only modest source control. Therefore, until vaccination rates are very high, continued layered controls and tight-fitting masks and respirators will be necessary.},

  abstract     = {Although short-range large-droplet transmission is possible for most respiratory infectious agents, deciding on whether the same agent is also airborne has a potentially huge impact on the types (and costs) of infection control interventions that are required.
The concept and definition of aerosols is also discussed, as is the concept of large droplet transmission, and airborne transmission which is meant by most authors to be synonymous with aerosol transmission, although some use the term to mean either large droplet or aerosol transmission.
However, these terms are often used confusingly when discussing specific infection control interventions for individual pathogens that are accepted to be mostly transmitted by the airborne (aerosol) route (e.g. tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox). It is therefore important to clarify such terminology, where a particular intervention, like the type of personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used, is deemed adequate to intervene for this potential mode of transmission, i.e. at an N95 rather than surgical mask level requirement.
With this in mind, this review considers the commonly used term of 'aerosol transmission' in the context of some infectious agents that are well-recognized to be transmissible via the airborne route. It also discusses other agents, like influenza virus, where the potential for airborne transmission is much more dependent on various host, viral and environmental factors, and where its potential for aerosol transmission may be underestimated.},

We conducted longitudinal swab sampling of high-touch non-porous surfaces in a Massachusetts town during a COVID-19 outbreak from April to June 2020. Twenty-nine of 348 (8.3 percent) surface samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including crosswalk buttons, trash can handles, and door handles of essential business entrances (grocery store, liquor store, bank, and gas station). The estimated risk of infection from touching a contaminated surface was low (less than 5 in 10,000) by quantitative microbial risk assessment, suggesting fomites play a minimal role in SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. The weekly percentage of positive samples (out of n = 33 unique surfaces per week) best predicted variation in city-level COVID-19 cases with a 7-day lead time. Environmental surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on high-touch surfaces may be a useful tool to provide early warning of COVID-19 case trends.},

Science explains the mechanisms of such transport and there is evidence that this is a significant route of infection in indoor environments. Despite this, no countries or authorities consider airborne spread of COVID-19 in their regulations to prevent infections transmission indoors. It is therefore extremely important, that the national authorities acknowledge the reality that the virus spreads through air, and recommend that adequate control measures be implemented to prevent further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in particularly removal of the virus-laden droplets from indoor air by ventilation.},

However, assessing the effectiveness of those intervention practices hinges on the understanding of virus transmission, which remains uncertain. Here we show that airborne transmission is highly virulent and represents the dominant route to spread the disease. By analyzing the trend and mitigation measures in Wuhan, China, Italy, and New York City, from January 23 to May 9, 2020, we illustrate that the impacts of mitigation measures are discernable from the trends of the pandemic. Our analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the pandemic trends in the three epicenters. This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public. We conclude that wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in conjunction with simultaneous social distancing, quarantine, and contact tracing, represents the most likely fighting opportunity to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work also highlights the fact that sound science is essential in decision-making for the current and future public health pandemics.},

  abstract  = {Background
A recurrent feature of infectious diseases is the observation that different individuals show different levels of secondary transmission. This inter-individual variation in transmission potential is often quantified by the dispersion parameter k. Low values of k indicate a high degree of variability and a greater probability of superspreading events. Understanding k for COVID-19 across contexts can assist policy makers prepare for future pandemics.

Methods
A literature search following a systematic approach was carried out in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv and arXiv to identify publications containing epidemiological findings on superspreading in COVID-19. Study characteristics, epidemiological data, including estimates for k and R0, and public health recommendations were extracted from relevant records.

Results
The literature search yielded 28 peer-reviewed studies. The mean k estimates ranged from 0.04 to 2.97. Among the 28 studies, 93percent reported mean k estimates lower than one, which is considered as marked heterogeneity in inter-individual transmission potential. Recommended control measures were specifically aimed at preventing superspreading events. The combination of forward and backward contact tracing, timely confirmation of cases, rapid case isolation, vaccination and preventive measures were suggested as important components to suppress superspreading.

Conclusions
Superspreading events were a major feature in the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2. On the one hand, this made outbreaks potentially more explosive but on the other hand also more responsive to public health interventions. Going forward, understanding k is critical for tailoring public health measures to high-risk groups and settings where superspreading events occur.},

While SARS-CoV-2 often infects the gastrointestinal tract of infected people, its presence as infectious, replication-capable virus in environmental fecal wastes and waters has never been documented. There is only rare and unquantified evidence of infectious, replication-capable SARS-CoV-2 in recently shed feces of COVID-19 hospital patients. The human infectivity dose-response relationship of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, thereby making it impossible to estimate evidence-based quantitative health effects assessments by quantitative microbial risk assessment methods requiring both known exposure assessment and health effects assessment data.

However, characterizing the size distribution of virus-containing aerosol particles has been challenging as high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in exhaled air is mainly present close to symptom onset. We present a case study of a person with COVID-19 who was able to participate in extensive measurements of exhaled aerosols already on the day of symptom onset and then for the following three days.

Aerosol collection was performed using an eight-stage impactor while the subject was breathing, talking and singing, for 30 min each, once every day. In addition, nasopharyngeal samples, saliva samples, room air samples and information on symptom manifestations were collected every day. Samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in seven of the eight particle size fractions, from 0.34 to smaller 8.1 microm, with the highest concentrations found in 0.94 to 2.8 microm particles. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was highest on the day of symptom onset, and declined for each day thereafter.

Our data showed that 90percent of the exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in aerosol particles smaller 4.5 microm, indicating the importance of small particles for the transmission of COVID-19 close to symptom onset. These results are important for our understanding of airborne transmission, for developing accurate models and for selecting appropriate mitigation strategies.},

  abstract  = {Understanding infection transmission between individuals, as well as evaluating the efficacy of protective measures, are key issues in pandemics driven by human respiratory particles. The key is a quantitative understanding of the size and concentration of particles exhaled and their variability across the size range for a representative population of all ages, genders, and different activities. Here we present data from 132 healthy volunteers aged 5 to 80 years, measured over the entire particle size range for each individual. Conventional particle spectrometry was combined with in-line holography under well-controlled conditions for common activities such as breathing, speaking, singing, and shouting. We find age to be the most important parameter for the concentration of small exhale particles smaller 5microm (PM5), which doubles over a 7-year period in adolescents and over a 30-year period in adults. Gender, body mass index, smoking or exercise habits have no discernible effect. We provide evidence that particles with a diameter of smaller 5microm originate from the lower respiratory tract, 5-15microm from the larynx/pharynx, and greater15microm from the oral cavity. PM5 concentration can vary by one order of magnitude within a person, while inter-person variability can span two orders of magnitude, largely explained by difference in age. We found no discernible inter-person variability for particles larger than 5microm. Our results show that cumulative volume of PM5 is 2-8 times higher in adults than in children. In contrast, number and volume concentration of larger particles, which are produced predominantly in the upper respiratory tract, is largely independent of age. Finally, we examined different types of airborne-transmissible respiratory diseases and provided insights into possible modes of infection transmission with and without several types/fits of face masks.},

  abstract  = {The well-mixed assumption has been widely used in predicting the spread of infectious diseases in indoor spaces. It is to be expected that a perfect well-mixed state will not be achieved in an indoor space at any reasonable level of ventilation. This work evaluates the well-mixed assumption by comparing the theory with results from large eddy simulations. The robustness of the well-mixed theory is established by comparing at four different levels. The comparison also points out systematic departures in pathogen concentration which can be accurately accounted for with an easily implementable correction factor to quantities such as cumulative exposure time. With the well-mixed model as the baseline, the correction factor can be used to account for additional important problem-specific details. We demonstrate that more accurately accounting for variability in pathogen concentration can help obtain improved estimates for enhanced guidelines of indoor airborne transmission. We further demonstrate that at source-sink separation distances smaller than 5 m, the well-mixed theory on average underestimates the risk of contagion, while for distances larger than about 5 m, the well-mixed theory's prediction, on average, is overly restrictive.},

  abstract  = {Networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a 'mixing network'. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks - and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm - have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures.

Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control.},

The theoretical analysis of epidemic spreading in heterogeneous networks requires the development of novel analytical frameworks, and it has produced results of conceptual and practical relevance. A coherent and comprehensive review of the vast research activity concerning epidemic processes is presented, detailing the successful theoretical approaches as well as making their limits and assumptions clear. Physicists, mathematicians, epidemiologists, computer, and social scientists share a common interest in studying epidemic spreading and rely on similar models for the description of the diffusion of pathogens, knowledge, and innovation. For this reason, while focusing on the main results and the paradigmatic models in infectious disease modeling, the major results concerning generalized social contagion processes are also presented.

It may remain practically such for some length of time; and the hypothetical results of this condition have therefore been analysed above in detail; but nature abhors a straight line, and we may infer from general experience that changes are sure to occur from time to time. As suggested in Section I, changes in infectivity may be due - (a) to the action, so to speak, of the infecting organisms themselves - which is difficult to believe in because it involves the conception that organisms living in large numbers of different hosts should, as it were, make a kind of concerted and simultaneous effort; and (b) to changes in season, climate, or other environment which may (1) increase or diminish the infective strength of the infecting organisms; or (2) facilitate or hinder their transference from one host to another.},

In this review, the role of aerosols in SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus transmission is discussed from the biophysical perspective. The essential properties of the coronavirus virus transported inside aerosol droplets, their successive inhalation, and size-dependent deposition in the respiratory system are highlighted. The importance of face covers (respirators and masks) in the reduction of aerosol spreading is analyzed. Finally, the discussion of the physicochemical phenomena of the coronavirus entering the surface of lung liquids (bronchial mucus and pulmonary surfactant) is presented with a focus on a possible role of interfacial phenomena in pulmonary alveoli.

We propose instead that droplet and aerosol transmission should be replaced by a unique airborne transmission mode, to be distinguished from contact transmission.},

  abstract  = {Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission via exhaled aerosol particles has been considered an important route for the spread of infection, especially during super-spreading events involving loud talking or singing. However, no study has previously linked measurements of viral aerosol emissions to transmission rates.

Methods
During February-March 2021, COVID-19 cases that were close to symptom onset were visited with a mobile laboratory for collection of exhaled aerosol particles during breathing, talking, and singing, respectively, and of nasopharyngeal and saliva samples. Aerosol samples were collected using a BioSpot-VIVAS and a NIOSH bc-251 2-stage cyclone, and all samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection. We compared transmission rates between households with aerosol-positive and aerosol-negative index cases.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in at least 1 aerosol sample from 19 of 38 (50 percent) included cases. The odds ratio (OR) of finding positive aerosol samples decreased with each day from symptom onset (OR 0.55, 95 confidence interval [CI] .30 1.0, P=.049). The highest number of positive aerosol samples were from singing, 16 (42 percent), followed by talking, 11 (30 percent), and the least from breathing, 3 (8 percent). Index cases were identified for 13 households with 31 exposed contacts. Higher transmission rates were observed in households with aerosol-positive index cases, 10/16 infected (63 percent), compared to households with aerosol-negative index cases, 4/15 infected (27 percent) (2 test, P=.045).

Conclusions
COVID-19 cases were more likely to exhale SARS-CoV-2-containing aerosol particles close to symptom onset and during singing or talking as compared to breathing. This study supports that individuals with SARS-CoV-2 in exhaled aerosols are more likely to transmit COVID-19.},

Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62 71 percent ethanol, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide or 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05 0.2 percent benzalkonium chloride or 0.02 percent chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.},

However, aerosol sampling in COVID departments is not straightforward, especially in the sub-500-nm size range. In this study, particle number concentrations were measured with high temporal resolution using an optical particle counter, and several 8 h daytime sample sets were collected simultaneously on gelatin filters with cascade impactors in two different hospital wards during both alpha and delta variants of concern periods. Due to the large number (152) of size-fractionated samples, SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies could be statistically analyzed over a wide range of aerosol particle diameters (70-10 microm). Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is most likely to exist in particles with 0.5-4 microm aerodynamic diameter, but also in ultrafine particles. Correlation analysis of particulate matter (PM) and RNA copies highlighted the importance of indoor medical activity. It was found that the daily maximum increment of PM mass concentration correlated the most with the number concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the corresponding size fractions. Our results suggest that particle resuspension from surrounding surfaces is an important source of SARS-CoV-2 RNA present in the air of hospital rooms.},

Smoke models on dummies have provided a visual image of possible aerosol behaviour and indicate a possible zone of transmission. However, they are not necessarily representative of the behaviour of a respiratory aerosol and any infectious particles contained therein. No quantitative study has yet been carried out on AGPs. Bronchoscopy and sputum induction have been associated with nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis, and guidelines have been produced describing the appropriate ventilation, isolation and respiratory protection that should be applied when carrying out such procedures. The uncertainty surrounding AGPs makes it difficult to construct effective infection control policy. The protection of healthcare workers is paramount. However, during a pandemic, resources may be stretched. Therefore it is important to clarify whether these procedures do generate aerosols.},

Although this review highlights the indirect transmission of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through wastewater aerosols, no research has yet clearly demonstrated the role of aerosolized wastewater in disease transmission regarding the continuation of this pandemic.

  abstract     = {Background
The Influenza A H1N1 virus can be transmitted via direct, indirect, and airborne route to non-infected subjects when an infected patient coughs, which expels a number of different sized droplets to the surrounding environment as an aerosol. The objective of the current study was to characterize the human cough aerosol pattern with the aim of developing a standard human cough bioaerosol model for Influenza Pandemic control.

Method
45 healthy non-smokers participated in the open bench study by giving their best effort cough. A laser diffraction system was used to obtain accurate, time-dependent, quantitative measurements of the size and number of droplets expelled by the cough aerosol.

Results
Voluntary coughs generated droplets ranging from 0.1 - 900 microns in size. Droplets of less than one-micron size represent 97 percent of the total number of measured droplets contained in the cough aerosol. Age, sex, weight, height and corporal mass have no statistically significant effect on the aerosol composition in terms of size and number of droplets.

Conclusions
We have developed a standard human cough aerosol model. We have quantitatively characterized the pattern, size, and number of droplets present in the most important mode of person-to-person transmission of IRD: the cough bioaerosol. Small size droplets (< 1 microm) predominated the total number of droplets expelled when coughing. The cough aerosol is the single source of direct, indirect and/or airborne transmission of respiratory infections like the Influenza A H1N1 virus.

The OPC indicated a preponderance of particles less than 1 ?, although larger particles were also found.

  abstract  = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease that is closely associated with poverty, with transmission occurring in situations where infected persons are in close contact with others in confined spaces. While it is well recognised that overcrowding increases the risk of transmission, this increased risk has not been quantified and the relationship between overcrowding and duration of exposure is not well understood. This paper analyses three epidemiological models that have been used to predict the transmission of airborne disease in confined spaces: the Mass Action model, Riley, Murphy and Riley's model and Gammaitoni and Nucci's model. A study is presented to demonstrate the range of applicability of each model and show how they can be applied to the transmission of both TB and diseases with short incubation periods such as measles. Gammiatoni and Nucci's generalised formulation is shown to be the most suitable for modelling airborne transmission in ventilated spaces, and it is subsequently used in a parametric study to evaluate the effect of physical and environmental factors on the rate of disease transmission. The paper also presents reported quanta production data for several TB outbreaks and demonstrates that the greatest risk of TB infection is during clinical procedures that produce large quantities of aerosol, such as bronchoscopy or intubation.},

  abstract  = {We evaluated the efficacy of recommended tuberculosis (TB) infection control measures by using a deterministic mathematical model for airborne contagion. We examined the percentage of purified protein derivative conversions under various exposure conditions, environmental controlstrategies, and respiratory protective devices. We conclude that environmental control cannot eliminate the risk for TB transmission during high-risk procedures; respiratory protective devices, and particularly high-efficiency particulate air masks, may provide nearly complete protection if used with air filtration or ultraviolet irradiation. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these control measures decreases as the infectivity of the source case increases. Therefore, administrative control measures (e.g., indentifying and isolating patients with infectious TB) are the most effective because they substantially reduce the rate of infection.},

We assume that the infectious aerosol concentration is governed by an advection-diffusion-reaction equation with the aerosols advected by airflow, diffused due to turbulence, emitted by infected people, and removed due to ventilation, inactivation of the virus and gravitational settling. We consider one asymptomatic or presymptomatic infectious person breathing or talking, with or without a mask, and model a quasi-three-dimensional set-up that incorporates a recirculating air-conditioning flow. We derive a semi-analytic solution that enables fast simulations and compare our predictions to three real-life case studies-a courtroom, a restaurant, and a hospital ward-demonstrating good agreement. We then generate predictions for the concentration and the infection risk in a classroom, for four different ventilation settings. We quantify the significant reduction in the concentration and the infection risk as ventilation improves, and derive appropriate power laws. The model can be easily updated for different parameter values and can be used to make predictions on the expected time taken to become infected, for any location, emission rate, and ventilation level. The results have direct applicability in mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract  = {Escalating demands of assessing airborne disease infection risks had been awakened from ongoing pandemics. An inhalation index linked to biomedical characteristics of pathogens (e.g. TCID50 for coronavirus delta variant) was proposed to quantify human uptake dose. A modified Wells-Riley risk-assessment framework was then developed with enhanced capability of integrating biological and spatiotemporal features of infectious pathogens into assessment. The instantaneous transport characteristics of pathogens were traced by Eulerian-Lagrangian method. Droplets released via speaking and coughing in a conference room with three ventilation strategies were studied to assess occupants' infection risks using this framework. Outcomes revealed that speaking droplets could travel with less distance (0.5 m) than coughing droplets (1 m) due to the frequent interaction between speaking flow and thermal plume. Quantified analysis of inhalation index revealed a higher inhalation possibility of droplets with nuclei size smaller than 5microm , and this cut-off size was found sensitive to ventilation. With only 60-second exposure, occupants in the near-field of host started to have considerable infection risks (approximately 20 percent). This risk was found minimising over distance exponentially. This modified framework demonstrated the systematic analysis of airborne transmission, from quantifying particle inhalation possibility, targeting specific disease's TCID50 , to ultimate evaluation of infection risks},

  abstract  = {Background
To propose infection prevention measures it is essential to understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 shedding, particularly in asymptomatic patients. This report compares the viral load progression in exhaled breath (EB) with the symptom severity. We aim to evaluate the adequacy of symptom assessment regarding the infectivity level of individuals.

Methods
We observed infected patients since their first positive test during hospitalization. EB samples were collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12 and 14 of hospitalization using a filter-based device. After extraction, viral loads were quantified with qRT-PCR. The infection trajectory was documented after symptom onset.

Case Presentation and Discussion
A 34-year old patient showed mild symptoms, e.g. fever, cough, headache, muscle pain and loss of taste and smell across trajectory of infection (Case 1). The viral loads emitted via exhaling were nearly constant and ranged from 8.6 x 103 and 4.1 x 104 RNA copies per hour. After the infection, the patient developed a pneumonia. The second case of a 65-year old patient depicted an asymptomatic infection trajectory for 14 days after the first diagnosis (Case 2). Nevertheless, the patient exhaled up to 2 x 105 SARS-CoV-2 virus copies hourly, approximately 10 fold higher than measured for Case 1.

Conclusion
Symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients exhale distinctive amounts of SARS-CoV-2 not necessarily correlating with symptom severity. Particularly, asymptomatic patients might show higher EB viral shedding. Therefore, EB testing should be included in infection prevention measures as it has high potential to reveal the most infectious individuals regardless of their symptoms during infection.},

  abstract  = {The need for a planned response to a deliberate introduction of smallpox has recently become urgent. We constructed a stochastic simulator of the spread of smallpox in structured communities to compare the effectiveness of mass vaccination versus targeted vaccination of close contacts of cases. Mass vaccination before smallpox introduction or immediately after the first cases was more effective than targeted vaccination in preventing and containing epidemics if there was no prior herd immunity (that is, no prior immunologic protection within the population). The effectiveness of postrelease targeted and mass vaccinations increased if we assumed that there was residual immunity in adults vaccinated before 1972, but the effectiveness of targeted vaccination increased more than that of mass vaccination. Under all scenarios, targeted vaccination prevented more cases per dose of vaccine than did mass vaccination. Although further research with larger-scale structured models is needed, our results suggest that increasing herd immunity, perhaps with a combination of preemptive voluntary vaccination and vaccination of first responders, could enhance the effectiveness of postattack intervention. It could also help targeted vaccination be more competitive with mass vaccination at both preventing and containing a deliberate introduction of smallpox.},

  abstract  = {Diverse control measures can be applied to reduce tuberculosis infection risk in health-care facilities. Selecting optimal controls requires methods for predicting the dependence of infections risk on underlying parameters. A common model for infection risk only explicitly accounts for control by ventilation. This paper proposes a more complete model for evaluating tuberculosis infection control methods in health-care settings. An infection risk parameter is defined as the probable number of infectious droplet nuclei inhaled by all susceptible persons from a single infectious person. Algebraic model equations are presented for two exposure cases. In one, the susceptible and infectious persons are together in a well-mixed indoor environment; in the socond, the infectious person is in respiratory isolation. Model equations are used to explore many common tuberculosis control measures: identification, isolation and treatment of tuberculosis cases; surgical masks and treatment booths applied at the source; environmental controls such as ventilation, air filtration, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation; and respiratory protection for susceptible persons. Experimental data are limited or lacking on some key variables, such as emissions of infectious droplet nuclei by contagious persons and air leakage rates from isolation rooms. Methods are outlined for collecting additional data.},

  abstract  = {An adverse health impact is often treated as a binary variable (response vs. no response), in which case the risk of response is defined as a monotonically increasing function R of the dose received D. For a population of size N, specifying the forms of R(D) and of the probability density function (pdf) for D allows determination of the pdf for risk, and computation of the mean and variance of the distribution of incidence, where the latter parameters are denoted E(SN) and Var(SN), respectively. The distribution of SN describes uncertainty in the future incidence value. Given variability in dose (and risk) among population members, the distribution of incidence is Poisson-binomial. However, depending on the value of E(SN), the distribution of incidence is adequately approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter mu=E(SN), or by a normal distribution with mean and variance equal to E(SN) and Var(SN). The general analytical framework is applied to occupational infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). Tuberculosis is transmitted by inhalation of 1-5 microm particles carrying viable M. tb bacilli. Infection risk has traditionally been modeled by the expression: R(D)= 1 - exp(-D), where D is the expected number of bacilli that deposit in the pulmonary region. This model assumes that the infectious dose is one bacillus. The beta pdf and the gamma pdf are shown to be reasonable and especially convenient forms for modeling the distribution of the expected cumulative dose across a large healthcare worker cohort. Use of the the analytical framework is illustrated by estimating the efficacy of different respiratory protective devices in reducing healthcare worker infection risk.},

In addition to the standard but unrealistic case of fixed infectiveness time and fixed and uncorrelated probability of transmission between all pairs of individuals, we solve cases in which times and probabilities are nonuniform and correlated. We also consider one simple case of an epidemic in a structured population, that of a sexually transmitted disease in a population divided into men and women.

This model combines a stochastic local infection dynamics among individuals with stochastic transport in a worldwide network, taking into account national and international civil aviation traffic. Our simulations of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak are in surprisingly good agreement with published case reports. We show that the high degree of predictability is caused by the strong heterogeneity of the network. Our model can be used to predict the worldwide spread of future infectious diseases and to identify endangered regions in advance. The performance of different control strategies is analyzed, and our simulations show that a quick and focused reaction is essential to inhibiting the global spread of epidemics.},

The graphs are generated by large-scale individual-based urban traffic simulations built on actual census, land-use and population-mobility data. We find that the contact network among people is a strongly connected small-world-like graph with a well-defined scale for the degree distribution. However, the locations graph is scale-free, which allows highly efficient outbreak detection by placing sensors in the hubs of the locations network. Within this large-scale simulation framework, we then analyse the relative merits of several proposed mitigation strategies for smallpox spread. Our results suggest that outbreaks can be contained by a strategy of targeted vaccination combined with early detection without resorting to mass vaccination of a population.},

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been widely employed as a fast, reliable, and inexpensive technique to support decision-making and to envisage mitigatory protocols. Nonetheless, the airborne pathogen droplet CFD modeling encounters limitations due to the oversimplification of involved physics and the intensive computational demand. Moreover, uncertainties in the collected clinical data required to simulate airborne and aerosol transport such as droplets' initial velocities, tempo-spatial profiles, release angle, and size distributions are broadly reported in the literature. There is a noticeable inconsistency around these collected data amongst many reported studies. This study aims to review the capabilities and limitations associated with CFD modeling. Setting the CFD models needs experimental data of respiratory flows such as velocity, particle size, and number distribution. Therefore, this paper briefly reviews the experimental techniques used to measure the characteristics of airborne pathogen droplet transmissions together with their limitations and reported uncertainties. The relevant clinical data related to pathogen transmission needed for postprocessing of CFD data and translating them to safety measures are also reviewed. Eventually, the uncertainty and inconsistency of the existing clinical data available for airborne pathogen CFD analysis are scurtinized to pave a pathway toward future studies ensuing these identified gaps and limitations.},

This revision was motivated by the availability of increased knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory tract and of the deposition, clearance, and biological effects of inhaled radioactive particles, and by greatly expanded dosimetry requirements. To meet fully the needs of radiation protection, a dosimetric model for the respiratory tract should:

- provide calculations of doses for individual members of the populations of all ethnic groups, in addition to workers;
- be useful for predictive and assessment purposes as well as for deriving limits on intakes;
- account for the influence of smoking, air pollutants, and respiratory tract diseases;
- provide for estimates of respiratory tract tissue doses from bioassay data; and
- be equally applicable to radioactive gases as well as to particles.

Addressing all of these requirements has resulted in a dosimetry model that is more complex than previous models.},

  abstract  = {A fast-computational 3D model comprising fluid dynamics with heat transfer, mass transfer and diffusion of diluted species has been adapted and employed to evaluate dispersion of aerosol particles in various environments. Effects of convection flow, atmospheric diffusivity and humidity on evolution and travel distances of exhaled aerosol clouds by an infected person are modelled. The modelling clearly demonstrates how aerosol particle dispersion is influenced by weather and geometry of the environment. The results obtained demonstrate that aerosol particles of sizes from 10 micrometer to 100 micrometer that potentially can carry SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) viruses travel over 30 m in some atmospheric conditions. Modelling of the evolution of aerosol clouds generated by coughing and sneezing enables us to evaluate the deposition dose of aerosol particles in healthy individuals. In realistic weather scenarios viruses can be deposited in the respiratory tract of a healthy individual at up to 200 virus copies in several minutes. A metric based on aerosol particle (volume) size distribution and the ICRP lung deposition model is suggested.},

  abstract  = {Real-time forecasts based on mathematical models can inform critical decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and bias of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time for Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but model predictions were increasingly unreliable at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making based on predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.},

  abstract  = {The CDC recommends that healthcare settings provide influenza patients with facemasks as a means of reducing transmission to staff and other patients, and a recent report suggested that surgical masks can capture influenza virus in large droplet spray. However, there is minimal data on influenza virus aerosol shedding, the infectiousness of exhaled aerosols, and none on the impact of facemasks on viral aerosol shedding from patients with seasonal influenza.
We collected samples of exhaled particles (one with and one without a facemask) in two size fractions from 37 volunteers within 5 days of seasonal influenza onset, measured viral copy number using quantitative RT-PCR, and tested the fine-particle fraction for culturable virus.
Fine particles contained 8.8 fold more viral copies than did coarse particles. Surgical masks reduced viral copy numbers in the fine fraction by 2.8 fold and in the coarse fraction by 25 fold. Overall, masks produced a 3.4 fold reduction in viral aerosol shedding. Correlations between nasopharyngeal swab and the aerosol fraction copy numbers were weak. Copy numbers in exhaled breath declined rapidly with day after onset of illness. Two subjects with the highest copy numbers gave culture positive fine particle samples.},

  abstract  = {SARS-CoV-2 viral load and detection of infectious virus in the respiratory tract are the two key parameters for estimating infectiousness. As shedding of infectious virus is required for onward transmission, understanding shedding characteristics is relevant for public health interventions. Viral shedding is influenced by biological characteristics of the virus, host factors and pre-existing immunity (previous infection or vaccination) of the infected individual. Although the process of human-to-human transmission is multifactorial, viral load substantially contributed to human-to-human transmission, with higher viral load posing a greater risk for onward transmission. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have further complicated the picture of virus shedding. As underlying immunity in the population through previous infection, vaccination or a combination of both has rapidly increased on a global scale after almost 3 years of the pandemic, viral shedding patterns have become more distinct from those of ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that influence infectious virus shedding and the period during which individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 are contagious is crucial to guide public health measures and limit transmission. Furthermore, diagnostic tools to demonstrate the presence of infectious virus from routine diagnostic specimens are needed.},

  abstract  = {The impact of ambient relative humidity (RH) and airflow patterns on the evaporation and dispersion of infectious droplets exhaled from an infector was studied by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The DPM (discrete phase model) was employed to calculate the two phase flow, i.e. droplets and air. The model is validated by experimental and simulation results in literature. Pure water droplets with different diameters (every 10microm between 10microm and 100microm) are exhaled from an infector in different ventilation systems, i.e. mixing and displacement with different RHs (0, 30 percent, 60 percent and 90 percent). The diameter variation, spatial distribution and spreading distance of droplets are simulated and compared. Results showed that evaporation of droplets under mixing ventilation is quicker than it under displacement ventilation due to accelerated heat and mass transfer between droplets and air by turbulence. However, the dried out time for small droplets (e.g. 10microm) are extremely short, whatever the ventilation system is. Slow air velocity in displacement system or high RH environment may lower the evaporation speed of middle size droplets (e.g. 50microm) and accelerate the dropping of large size droplets (e.g. 200microm). For 100microm droplets, they evaporate fast with low RHs while deposit fast with high RHs. Most droplets concentrate within plus/minus 0.5m of the person's mouth before they become droplet nuclei or fall onto the ground. This model may offer some suggestions in identifying favorable humidity-control ways to prevent the short-range infection transmission.},

  abstract  = {This rapid systematic review of evidence asks whether (i) wearing a face mask, (ii) one type of mask over another and (iii) mandatory mask policies can reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, either in community-based or healthcare settings. A search of studies published 1 January 2020-27 January 2023 yielded 5185 unique records. Due to a paucity of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies were included in the analysis. We analysed 35 studies in community settings (three RCTs and 32 observational) and 40 in healthcare settings (one RCT and 39 observational). Ninety-five per cent of studies included were conducted before highly transmissible Omicron variants emerged. Ninety-one per cent of observational studies were at 'critical' risk of bias (ROB) in at least one domain, often failing to separate the effects of masks from concurrent interventions. More studies found that masks (n=39of47; 83percent) and mask mandates (n=16of18; 89percent) reduced infection than found no effect (n=8of65; 12percent) or favoured controls (n=1of65; 2percent). Seven observational studies found that respirators were more protective than surgical masks, while five found no statistically significant difference between the two mask types. Despite the ROB, and allowing for uncertain and variable efficacy, we conclude that wearing masks, wearing higher quality masks (respirators), and mask mandates generally reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission in these study populations.},

We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished empirical studies, either observational or interventional, analysing the comparative effectiveness of NPIs against the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched Embase Medline and medRxiv to identify the relevant literature.

We identified 34 studies. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, school closing was the most effective NPI, followed by workplace closing, business and venue closing and public event bans. Public information campaigns and mask wearing requirements were also effective in controlling the pandemic while being less disruptive for the population than other NPIs. There was no evidence on the effectiveness of public transport closure, testing and contact tracing strategies and quarantining or isolation of individuals. Early implementation was associated with a higher effectiveness in reducing COVID-19 cases and deaths, while general stringency of the NPIs was not.

In this systematic review, we found that school closing, followed by workplace closing, business and venue closing and public event bans were the most effective NPIs in controlling the spread of COVID-19. An early response and a combination of specific social distancing measures are effective at reducing COVID-19 cases and deaths. Continuous monitoring of NPIs effectiveness is needed in order to adapt decision making.},
