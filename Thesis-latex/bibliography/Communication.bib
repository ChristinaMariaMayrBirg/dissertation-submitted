 abstract = {SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) has become one of the preferred open-source platforms for researchers to perform microscopic road traffic simulation. Thanks to the Traffic Control Interface (TraCI), SUMO offers a high level of flexibility, allowing a client to retrieve and modify the objects in the simulation. Two implementations of TraCI have been released to date for Python (TraCI-Python) and Java (TraCI4j). On the other hand, Matlab is a software tool with a programming language with a broad user's community of researchers. Matlab is used in many tasks on simulation, control, optimization and it is a preferred tool for rapid prototyping. Both platforms share strengths that benefit the development of control strategies for road traffic. The desire of combining both strengths motivated the interest to develop a TraCI implementation for Matlab. This chapter describes an adaptive software re-engineering process of TraCI-Python used to implement TraCI4Matlab (TraCI for Matlab).},

 abstract = {IP mobility ensures network reachability and session continuity while IPv6 networks are on the move. In the Network Mobility (NEMO) model, the potential for NEMO Mobile Routers (MRs) to interconnect and extend Internet connectivity allows the formation Nested NEMO networks. With MANEMO, nested MRs can be efficiently interconnected in a tree-based structure with Internet access being maintained via a designated Gateway. However, this only supports single-homed Internet connectivity. With the span of wireless access technologies and the popularity of multi-interfaced devices, multihoming support in this scenario becomes critical. A Nested Mobile Network with heterogeneous available Internet access options would allow better overall network performance and optimal utilisation of available resources. In this paper, we present the Multihomed Mobile Network Architecture (MMNA), a comprehensive multihomed mobility solution. It provides a multihoming management mechanism for Gateway Discovery and Selection on top of a multihomed mobility model integrating different mobility and multihoming protocols. It enables a complex nested multihomed topology to be established with multiple gateways supporting heterogeneous Internet access. The results demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves better overall throughput, load sharing, and link failure recovery.},

 abstract = {A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a collection of wireless mobile nodes forming a temporary network without using any existing infrastructure. Since not many MANETs are currently deployed, research in this area is mostly simulation based. Random Waypoint is the commonly used mobility model in these simulations. Random Waypoint is a simple model that may be applicable to some scenarios. However, we believe that it is not sufficient to capture some important mobility characteristics of scenarios in which MANETs may be deployed. Our framework aims to evaluate the impact of different mobility models on the performance of MANET routing protocols. We propose various protocol independent metrics to capture interesting mobility characteristics, including spatial and temporal dependence and geographic restrictions. In addition, a rich set of parameterized mobility models is introduced including Random Waypoint, Group Mobility, Freeway and Manhattan models. Based on these models several test-suite scenarios are chosen carefully to span the metric space. We demonstrate the utility of our test-suite by evaluating various MANET routing protocols, including DSR, AODV and DSDV. Our results show that the protocol performance may vary drastically across mobility models and performance rankings of protocols may vary with the mobility models used. This effect can be explained by the interaction of the mobility characteristics with the connectivity graph properties. Finally, we attempt to decompose the reactive routing protocols into mechanistic building blocks to gain a deeper insight into the performance variations across protocols in the face of mobility.},

 abstract = {Dynamic navigation systems can substantially benefit from reliable real-time urban traffic information. In this paper a method is shown that calculates the current urban traffic state based on probe vehicle data from fleet vehicles. On all links where there is no information present, historical traffic data is used. The calculated velocity information is integrated into the dynamic on-board navigation system. In contrast to other routing solutions this method not only informs the driver about traffic congestion and dense traffic, but also about currently free-flowing traffic. The authors conclude by comparing the probe vehicle data approach to existing car-2-car based traffic information systems.},

 abstract = {Intervehicle communication has become an extremely hot topic in networking research, opening up new research challenges well beyond those of classical mobile ad hoc network research. In October 2010, a Dagstuhl seminar has been organized bringing together many of the internationally leading experts in this field to discuss open issues and challenges related to IVC. This article reports the main findings of this meeting, that was set up to cover a wide range of topics. In particular, the following four areas were studied in working groups: Fundamental Limits and Opportunities of IVC, IVC Communication Principles and Patterns, Security and Privacy in IVC, and IVC Simulation and Modeling. A general conclusion drawn is that IVC is now at a turning point where the firstgeneration systems are engineered and will soon be brought to the market, while at the same time, IVC is experiencing the beginning of a new era characterized by a more fundamental research approach.},

 abstract = {Growing of time-sensitive applications such as streaming multimedia, voice over IP and online gaming required strongly support from mobile communication technology. So, the persistent need for wireless broadband technologies such as LTE-A is essential. LTE-A can achieve QoS in an efficient manner by using a reliable packet scheduling algorithm. It also supports good cell coverage by using heterogeneous capability. In this paper, modifications of proportional fair (PF) algorithm are proposed with different methods to compute the average throughput, which is the main and important parameter in the PF cost function. These methods are geometric mean, root mean square and arithmetic mean. Vienna simulator is used to study the performance of the proposed algorithms. A comparison between PF modifications and the most famous algorithms (the original PF and Best CQI algorithms) with various UE velocities is introduced. Average UE throughput, spectral efficiency, energy per bit, cell throughput and fairness are used as performance indicators. The results expose that QPF has best improved values for spectral efficiency, energy per bit and fairness by 8.4%, 14%, and 9.3%, respectively than original PF. However, Best CQI has a better value of average UE and cell throughput than all algorithms of 2% and 1.8% in low and medium UE velocity, respectively, but the best value of all types of throughput at high speed is gained by QPF. QPF and GMPF has the same performance in fairness with all UEs speeds.},

 abstract = {Mass gatherings and mass pedestrian flows such as during holy rituals are always challenging for the management as well as for the people attending them. The holy city of Makkah hosts millions of pilgrim coming from all over the world each year during Ramadan and Hajj seasons. One of the main rituals is the tawaaf (circumambulation) of the Holy Kaaba. Knowing the average tawaaf time and flow rates of pilgrims around Holy Kaaba is beneficial in order to efficiently schedule the visit to the Sacred Mosque and avoid crowdedness. This paper discusses MMaPFlow approach for Mapping Mass Pedestrian Flow around Holy Kaaba using crowd-sourcing. The crowd-sourcing is done through pilgrim smartphone to calculate average tawaaf time and other statistics related to pilgrims movement around the Holy Kaaba.},

 abstract = {Context: Quality of Experience (QoE) enables the description of user perceptions about the performance of a particular application or service. In the mobile computing context, it is an important measure for service providers and users, since QoE makes it possible to improve it and make it more competitive to achieve user fidelity. In turn, the importance of QoE in mobile technologies increases due to the various factors that affect the applications that run on mobile devices. Objective: The purpose of this study is to identify the metrics and tools relevant to the scientific community for the QoE analysis of mobile applications. Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted. Results: From a total of 751 studies, 33 were selected, and 13 metrics and 15 mobile QoE analysis tools were identified. Conclusions: The existing mobile QoE analysis tools collect and calculate metrics automatically, combining objective and subjective metrics. However, they present limited approaches, making it difficult to carry out an integral analysis of the applications.},

 abstract = {Cellular Vehicle-to-X (Cellular V2X) is a communication technology that aims to facilitate the communication among vehicles and with the roadside infrastructure. Introduced with LTE Release 14, Cellular V2X enables device-to-device communication to support road safety and traffic efficiency applications. We present Artery-C, a simulation framework for the performance evaluation of Cellular V2X protocols and V2X applications. Our simulator relies on the simulation framework SimuLTE and substantially extends it by implementing control and user planes. Besides the vehicle-to-network communication via the up-/downlink interface, it provides vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-infrastructure communication via the sidelink interface using the managed and the unmanaged mode of Cellular V2X (mode 3 and 4, respectively). The simulator also implements advanced features of 5G mobile networks, such as variable numerologies. For the transmission of of V2X messages, it adds a non-IP interface. Artery-C integrates seamlessly into the simulation framework Artery, which enables the simulation of standardized V2X messages at the facilities layer as well as the coupling to the mobility simulator SUMO. A specific feature of Artery-C is the support of dynamic switching between all modes of Cellular V2X. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of Artery-C, we evaluate V2X-based platooning as a representative use case and present results for mode 3, mode 4 and mode switching in a highway scenario.},

@Article{hongyu-2019-com,
 abstract = {Location-Based Services (LBSs) provide valuable services, with convenient features for mobile users. However, the location and other information disclosed through each query to the LBS erodes user privacy. This is a concern especially because LBS providers can be honest-but-curious, collecting queries and tracking users??? whereabouts and infer sensitive user data. This motivated both centralized and decentralized location privacy protection schemes for LBSs: anonymizing and obfuscating LBS queries to not disclose exact information, while still getting useful responses. Decentralized schemes overcome disadvantages of centralized schemes, eliminating anonymizers, and enhancing users??? control over sensitive information. However, an insecure decentralized system could create serious risks beyond private information leakage. More so, attacking an improperly designed decentralized LBS privacy protection scheme could be an effective and low-cost step to breach user privacy. We address exactly this problem, by proposing security enhancements for mobile data sharing systems. We protect user privacy while preserving accountability of user activities, leveraging pseudonymous authentication with mainstream cryptography. We show our scheme can be deployed with off-the-shelf devices based on an experimental evaluation of an implementation in a static automotive testbed.},

 abstract = {The quality of experience (QoE) of the end-users is a critical criterion of measurement in VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) systems for technical and commercial purposes. We investigate how quality of service (QoS) influences QoE and assesses the QoE in VoIP communication. Our contributions are three-fold. First, the impacts of QoS on QoE are comprehensively analyzed by experimental means and an association test method, instead of independently studying each parameter. Second, an algorithm is proposed to integrate the effects of QoS parameters with spatial or temporal characteristics on QoE. Third, we apply machine learning regression algorithms with QoS impairments, noise and echo impairments to nonintrusive voice quality prediction in different network environments. The results from numerous experiments show that fairly accurate prediction can be obtained from these models. Our work will achieve a more accurate evaluation of the QoE in VoIP by using QoS parameters, clarify the influence of IP network environments, noise and echo impairments on the quality and reliability of VoIP traffic, and provide QoS parameter requirements for the VoIP application that runs at the desired QoE level.},

 abstract = {Abstract???This paper examines attitudes towards smartphone characteristics (features, functions and relative advantage indicators) from the users??? perspective. A questionnaire survey was conducted among smartphone users (n=486) from different countries, however, most of the respondents were Azerbaijanis or Hungarians. The results of the survey were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis which enables to group the most important variables based on their correlations. Six components were extracted and 65% of the total variance was explained by the components. Surprisingly, Personal Digital Assistant tasks and Technical Features seem to be more important for smartphone users than Relative Advantage indicators (i.e. including the price of the handset). The main purpose of the mobile/smartphones ??? being in touch ??? explains less than seven percent of the total variance. Afterward, the respondents were clustered in 5 groups according to Rogers??? [2003. Diffusion of innovations (5th ed.). New York, NY: Free Press] adopter categories, using the results of PCA for K-means cluster analysis. Based on the output of cluster analysis and final cluster centers, the adopter categories were defined. The results illustrate that the number of innovators and early adopters is significantly high in comparison with the original numbers offered by Rogers.},

@PhdThesis{kaerkkaeinen-2021-com,
 abstract = {Modern smartphones are the primary gateways to information, entertainment, social networks, and private relationships for billions of people.They typically achieve this by connecting to centralized Internet services via fast wireless links.

However, these smart devices have another, less used, set of communication
capabilities:They can also talk directly over device-to-device communication
technologies, and exchange content and messages without the need for the
Internet. Message passing over these contacts creates an Opportunistic or a
Delay-Tolerant Network.This form of networking is particularly useful in rural
and remote areas that lack infrastructure, and in urban areas where the
infrastructure has been overloaded by a crowd or disabled by a disaster. Even
when infrastructure is available, it allows networking without relinquishing
control and privacy to a centralized service.

In this dissertation, we contribute to advancing the availability and capability
of opportunistic networking. We advance the availability by improving the
opportunities for creating opportunistic contacts for smartphones, and the
capability by designing advanced mechanisms for both content and computation
interactions.

For connectivity, we measure to what extent existing public Wi-Fi access points
allow direct device-to-device communications. We then introduce mechanisms to
help scale device-to-device communications in access points with many clients.
As an alternative to using existing infrastructure, we introduce the Liberouter
neighborhood networking system based on cheap stand alone opportunistic routers.

On top of this basic connectivity, we design more advanced content access
mechanisms to ease the development of opportunistic networking applications. In
particular, we design a request/response mechanism for accessing content,
particularly websites, that reside on servers outside the opportunistic network.
We also design aquery/response mechanism to search for content in other nearby
devices. Finally, we present mechanisms for shared content editing, e.g., wikis,
in opportunistic networks.

We also introduce mechanisms to support opportunistic computations. First, we
enable interactive web applications in the Liberouter network by attaching
custom computations to the content messages. Second, we design a framework for
the Liberouters for the opportunistic composition of general distributed
services.Together, these contributions help advance the technical basis for
smartphone-based opportunistic networking applications.},

  abstract  = {When performing wireless network simulations, the lack of precise channel modeling in simulator frameworks becomes a serious problem. Often deterministic models are used for packet propagation, which describe real conditions insufficiently. To close this gap we extended the OMNeT++ Mobility Framework to support probabilistic propagation models. We provide an implementation for the Log-Normal-Shadowing, Nakagami, Rayleigh and Rice wave propagation models and set up a framework that allows easy integration of additional models in future.Due to the characteristics of probabilistic radio models a fixed maximum packet propagation range encounters the problem of inaccurate simulation results as relevant events may be suppressed. On the other hand, unlimited packet propagation, which guarantees for correct simulation runs, causes unnecessary simulation overhead. In this work we present an approach to limit the event delivery to the area where the probability that the event is relevant to the simulation exceeds an adjustable threshold. In order to validate our extensions we successfully performed a detailed crosscheck with the network simulator NS-2 and run a performance evaluation and comparison.},

 abstract = {In the face of cooperative intelligent transportation systems (C-ITS) advancements, the inclusion of vulnerable road users (VRU), i.e., pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists, has just recently become a part of the discussion. Including VRU in C-ITS presents new challenges, most notably the trade-off between the increase in VRU safety and the aggravation in channel congestion resulting from VRU-generated messages. However, previous studies mainly focus on network-related metrics without giving much consideration to VRU safety-related metrics. In this context, we evaluated such a trade-off with a study of motion-based message generation rules for VRU transmissions. The rules were analyzed using theoretical and simulation-based evaluations. In addition to studying the message generation rules using channel load metrics, such as channel busy ratio (CBR) and packet delivery ratio (PDR), we introduced a new metric: the VRU Awareness Probability (VAP). VAP uses the exchange of messages from active VRU to measure the probability of VRU detection by nearby vehicles. Results show that fixed message-filtering mechanisms reduce the overall channel load, but they could negatively impact VRU detection. We established the importance of quantifying the VRU awareness and its inclusion in C-ITS analysis because of its direct impact on VRU safety. We also discussed approaches that include VRU context and dynamism to improve the definition of message generation rules.},

To realize this novel paradigm, three novel tables, namely Content Store, Pending Interest Table (PIT) and Forwarding Information Base (FIB), are utilized in NDN forwarding plane. Designing and evaluating the quick enough forwarding plane with high capacity is a major challenge within the overall NDN research area. Since NDN was proposed in 2010, there have been many efforts focusing on this challenge and a rich literature has been developed. Unfortunately, there is a lack of the comprehensive sketch about the requirements of NDN forwarding plane and the study on various schemes proposed. Focusing on the above insufficiency, this survey gives the complete requirements and compares all the schemes proposed for NDN forwarding plane based on the data structure utilized. In addition, the survey also discusses some issues, challenges and directions in future research. It is considered that designing a novel data structure to meet all requirements of the forwarding plane and studying on a better structure of Content Store play important roles, while discussing the necessity of a unified index, combining with other contents in NDN research and implementing a unified benchmark are also required in this domain.},

@Article{naeem-2018-com,
 abstract = {Information centric network (ICN) is progressively becoming the revolutionary paradigm to the traditional Internet with improving data (content) distribution on the Internet along with global unique names. Some ICN-based architecture, such as named data network (NDN) and content centric network (CCN) has recently been developed to deal with prominent advantages to implement the basic idea of ICN. To improve the Internet services, its architecture design is shifting from host-centric (end-to-end) communication to receive-driven content retrieval. A prominent advantage of this novel architecture is that networks are equipped with transparent in-network caching to accelerate the content dissemination and improve the utilization of network resources. The gigantic increase of global network traffic poses new challenges to CCN caching technologies. It requires extensive flexibility for consumers to get information. One of the most imperative commonalities of CCN design is ubiquitous caching. It is broadly accepted that the in-network caching would improve the performance. ICN cache receives on several new characteristics: cache is ubiquitous, cache is transparent to application, and content to be cached is more significant. This paper presents a complete survey of state-of-art CCN-based probabilistic caching schemes aiming to address the caching issues, with certain focus on minimizing cache redundancy and improving the accessibility of cached content.},

 abstract = {Many cooperative behaviors of multi???agent teams emerge from local interactions among the agents, where an agent interacts with a few ???adjacent??? teammates, but has no information about the remaining agents. For instance, the self???organization of many biological populations ???including swarms of insects, flocks of birds, and schools of fish ???are based on such local interaction rules: the motion and decisions of an individual agent are determined by the behavior of its nearest neighbors in the population. A special case of multi???agent coordination is consensus, that is, the agreement of agents on some quantity of interest or, more generally, the full or partial synchronization of their state trajectories. Establishing consensus is a ???benchmark??? problem in multi???agent systems study, which allows to reveal the main principles of multi???agent coordination and, in particular, the role of the system's interaction graph (or topology). Consensus lies in the heart of many natural phenomena (e.g., synchronous oscillation of neural cells, which maintains a stable heart rhythm) and engineering designs (e.g., attitude synchronization of satellites). In this article, we give a brief review of distributed consensus algorithms, focusing on the basic ideas and relevant mathematical theory, in particular, graph???theoretic methods.},

  abstract = {Broadcast or flooding is a dissemination technique of paramount importance in wireless ad hoc networks. The broadcast scheme is widely used within routing protocols by a wide range of wireless ad hoc networks such as mobile ad hoc networks, vehicular ad hoc networks, and wireless sensor networks, and used to spread emergency messages in critical scenarios after a disaster scenario and/or an accidents. As the type broadcast scheme used plays an important role in the performance of the network, it has to be selected carefully. Though several types of broadcast schemes have been proposed, probabilistic broadcast schemes have been demonstrated to be suitable schemes for wireless ad hoc networks due to a range of benefits offered by them such as low overhead, balanced energy consumption, and robustness against failures and mobility of nodes. In the last decade, many probabilistic broadcast schemes have been proposed by researchers. In addition to reviewing the main features of the probabilistic schemes found in the literature, we also present a classification of the probabilistic schemes, an exhaustive review of the evaluation methodology including their performance metrics, types of network simulators, their comparisons, and present some examples of real implementations, in this paper.},

  abstract  = {This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol. RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services. RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services. The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality. RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers. The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes. There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},

 abstract = {5G networks will have to offer extremely high volumes of content, compared to those of today's. Moreover, they will have to support heterogeneous traffics, including machine-to-machine, generated by a massive volume of Internet-of-Things devices. Traffic demands will be variable in time and space. In this work, we argue that all this can be achieved in a cost-effective way if the network is flexible and reconfigurable. We present the Flex5Gware network architecture, designed to meet the above requirements. Moreover, we discuss the links between flexibility and reconfigurability, on the one side, and context awareness and content awareness, on the other; we show how two of the building blocks of the Flex5Gware architecture, namely on-the-fly MAC reconfiguration and dynamic multi-cell coordinated resource scheduling, can leverage context and content information to make reconfiguration decisions. Our evaluation, conducted by both prototyping and simulation, show that this brings significant benefits in terms of improved coexistence of heterogeneous access networks and reduced latency. We terminate our paper by discussing how the Flex5Gware architecture aims at influencing future system standardization and leveraging the benefits of some key 5G networking enablers described in the paper.},

 abstract = {In order to accurately evaluate new concepts and protocols for mobile communication
networks, realistic mobility models are needed. Furthermore, for use cases which have a
bidirectional dependency between communication and mobility, changes in communication
lead to changes in mobility and vice versa, thus requiring an online coupling between
models. Therefore, bidirectional coupling to incorporate realistic mobility patterns is state
of the art in the analysis of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) applications.
However, the same need exist for use cases where the mobile users are pedestrians rather
than vehicles. Therefore, this paper introduces our current, on-going work on connecting
OMNeT++ and Vadere, an open source simulation framework for microscopic pedestrian
dynamics, to benefit from state of the art pedestrian mobility models in mobile communication
use cases. The presented coupling is based on the existing Traffic Control Interface
(TraCI) protocol used in the Veins (Vehicles in Network Simulation) framework to connect
OMNeT++ with SUMO.},

  abstractnote = {Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication has emerged as an important mechanism to improve the safety and efficiency of road traffic. V2X communication encompasses Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) communication. Among these types, the V2P communication efforts continue to be in the preliminary stage and lack a rounded approach towards the development of V2P systems. V2P involves communication between vehicles and a wide variety of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), such as pedestrians, bicyclists, mopeds, etc. The V2X systems were originally developed only for V2V and V2I when solely the vehicle characteristics were in focus. However, effective V2P system design needs to consider the characteristics of VRUs. The differing characteristics of VRUs have given rise to many questions while adapting to the V2V communication model for the V2P system. This dissertation addresses three aspects pertaining to the development of the V2P safety system. The first aspect involves a systematic design of a V2P system using a holistic approach. This dissertation proposes a V2P design framework based on various categories of inputs that are required for the design of an effective V2P system. This framework improves the understanding of the V2P system requirements and helps make the design process more systematic. The second aspect is the network performance of the V2X network in the presence of a large number of VRUs. This dissertation proposes MC-COCO4V2P, which is an energy-efficient pedestrian clustering mechanism for network congestion mitigation. MC-COCO4V2P improves network performance by reducing the pedestrian-generated safety messages. It also improves the battery life of the pedestrian devices in the process. The third aspect involves the reliability of communication between a pair of a vehicle and a pedestrian that are on the verge of collision. This dissertation classifies such crucial communication as the one requiring the highest priority even among the exchange of critical safety messages. It proposes a mechanism enabling the surrounding nodes to reduce the communication priority temporarily. This results in preferred medium access for the pair resulting in higher Quality-of-Service (QoS) for the crucial communication.},

However many vehicular applications, such as information sharing for safety and real time traffic purposes, desire direct V2V communications which is difficult to achieve using the existing solutions. This paper explores the named-data approach to address this challenge. We use case studies to identify the design requirements and put forth a strawman proposal for the data name design to understand its advantages and limitations.},

 abstract = {Scoped-flooding is a technique for content discovery in a broad networking context. This paper investigates the effects of scoped-flooding on various topologies in information- centric networking. Using the proposed ring model, we show that flooding can be constrained within a very small neighbourhood to achieve most of the gains which come from areas where the growth rate is relatively low, i.e., the net- work edge. We also study two flooding strategies and com- pare their behaviours. Given that caching schemes favour more popular items in competition for cache space, popular items are expected to be stored in diverse parts of the network compared to the less popular items. We propose to exploit the resulting divergence in availability along with the routers' topological properties to fine tune the flooding radius. Our results shed light on designing efficient content discovery mechanism for future information-centric networks.},

 abstract = {Conventional Traffic and Travel Information (TTI) systems are based on a centralized structure: Sensors deployed at the roadside monitor the traffic and transmit the results to a central unit, which performs a situation analysis. TTI is made available to the drivers via broadcast service (e.g. TMC/RDS) or on demand via cellular phone. In contrast to this centralized approach. a decentralized, Self-Organizing Traffic Information System (SOTIS) based on Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) has many advantages: It requires no expensive infrastructure. can provide detailed information for the local area with low delay and is available everywhere. In such an IVC based decentralized system, TTI is sensed by each individual vehicle. The information is analyzed, combined with TTI received from other vehicles and the results are distributed using recurring broadcast packets. In this paper; an adaptive broadcast scheme for efficient TTI distribution called Provoked Broadcast is presented. The algorithm favors the propagation of significant TTI changes within the self-organizing network. Nodes adapt their communication behavior to the local environment and avoid redundant transmissions. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by using simulations of typical traffic scenarios. Compared to a strictly periodic broadcast, the new scheme decreases the average error of information available at an individual vehicle and still requires significantly less bandwidth.},

 abstract = {Intervehicle communication (IVC) is an emerging topic in research and application that is getting increasing attention from all major car manufacturers. In this paper, a novel method for scalable information dissemination in highly mobile ad hoc networks is proposed: segment-oriented data abstraction and dissemination (SODAD). With SODAD, information can be distributed in an information range multiple orders of magnitude larger than the transmission range of the air interface, even if only 1\%-3\% of all vehicles are equipped with an IVC system, e.g., during market introduction. By restricting the method to the dissemination of map/position-based data, scalability is achieved. In the second half of this paper, an example application for the SODAD method is presented: a self-organizing traffic-information system (SOTIS). In SOTIS, a car is equipped with a satellite navigation receiver, an IVC system, and a digital map. Each individual vehicle collects traffic information for its local area. Using the digital map, the traffic information is analyzed based on road segments. By distributing the information in the ad hoc intervehicle network using the SODAD method, a decentralized traffic information system is created. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using network simulation with vehicular mobility models. Simulation results for typical scenarios are presented. Furthermore, a prototype implementation based on commercially available standard hardware demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

In research related to 4G and 5G cellular communication, the
system-level simulation SimuLTE is a widely used model. Despite
its popularity, no results regarding an experimental validation of
this model are publicly available up to now. This paper presents
results of a first step in this direction: A small-scale completely
shielded cellular testbed based on OpenAirInterface is set up
and packet delay and inter-arrival time are measured in several
low and high load scenarios. Afterwards, the identical scenarios
are modeled in SimuLTE. The comparison of simulation and
measurement results indicate a good accuracy of the model for
low-load scenarios. However, in particular in overload conditions
involving more than one packet source the results differ
significantly. Subsequently, several adaptations to the model are
proposed which lead to a better agreement of simulation and
measurement results in the investigated scenarios.},

  title     = {On the Influence of Microscopic Mobility in Modelling Pedestrian Communication},
  abstract  = {In the recent past, wireless network simulations involving pedestrians are getting increasing attention within the research community. Examples are crowd networking, pedestrian communication via Sidelink/D2D, wireless contact tracing to fight the Covid-19 pandemic or the evaluation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) for the protection of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs).  Since in general the mobile communication depends on the position of the pedestrians, their mobility needs to be modeled. Often simplified mobility models such as the random-waypoint or cellular automata based models are used.

However, for ad hoc networks and Inter-Vehicular Communication (IVC), it is well-known that a detailed model for the microscopic mobility has a strong influence -- which is why state-of-the-art simulation frameworks for IVC often combine vehicular mobility and network simulators. Therefore, this paper investigates to what extent a detailed modelling of the pedestrian mobility on an operational level influences the results of Pedestrian-to-X Communication (P2X) and its applications. 

We model P2X scenarios within the open-source coupled simulation environment CrowNet. It
enables us to simulate the identical P2X scenario while varying the pedestrian mobility simulator as well as the used model. Two  communication scenarios (pedestrian to server via 5G New Radio, pedestrian to pedestrian via PC5 Sidelink) are investigated in different mobility scenarios.  Initial results demonstrate that time- and location-dependent factors represented by detailed microscopic mobility models can have a significant influence on the results of wireless communication simulations, indicating a need for more detailed pedestrian mobility models in particular for scenarios with pedestrian crowds.},

 abstractnote = {The assessment of Quality-of-Experience (QoE) corresponding to a given set of Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameters is of high importance for any mobile network operator. Methods for subjective QoE assessment such as MUlti Stimulus test with Hidden Reference and Anchors (MUSHRA) or Subjective Assessment Methodology for Video Quality (SAMVIQ) are based on collecting user feedback for one or several stimuli, i.e. differently processed versions of a source. Generating these stimuli corresponding to a given set of QoS parameters for a QoE assessment of a mobile application is a time-consuming, non-trivial task. Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel publicly available open-source framework for stimuli generation for QoE assessment of mobile applications. It is based on the combination of network emulation and automatic user-interface control of a real mobile device, whose behavior is recorded and post-processed to generate suitable stimuli. The article presents the basic concept of the framework, describes its open-source implementation, and concludes with an initial evaluation of the framework based on typical types of mobile applications.},

 abstract = {Vehicular information network and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been receiving a lot of attention in recent years. As one of the most important and promising IoT areas, a vehicular information network aims to implement a myriad of applications related to vehicles, traffic information, drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. However, intervehicular communication (IVC) in a vehicular information network is still based on the TCP/IP protocol stack which is not efficient and scalable. To address the efficiency and scalability issues of the IVC, we leverage the named data networking (NDN) paradigm where the end user only cares about the needed content and pays no attention to the actual location of the content. The NDN model is highly suitable for the IVC scenario with its hierarchical content naming scheme and flexible content retrieval and caching support. We design a novel vehicular information network architecture based on the basic communication principle of NDN. Our proposed architecture aims to improve content naming, addressing, data aggregation, and mobility for IVC in the vehicular information network. In addition, the key parameter settings of the proposed schemes are analyzed in order to help guide their actual deployment.},
