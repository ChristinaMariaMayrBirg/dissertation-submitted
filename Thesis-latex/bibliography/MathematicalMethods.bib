@article{alahmadi-2020-math,
 abstract = {The behaviour of many processes in science and engineering can be accurately described by dynamical system models consisting of a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Often these models have several unknown parameters that are difficult to estimate from experimental data, in which case Bayesian inference can be a useful tool. In principle, exact Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques is possible; however, in practice, such methods may suffer from slow convergence and poor mixing. To address this problem, several approaches based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) have been introduced, including Markov chain Monte Carlo ABC (MCMC ABC) and sequential Monte Carlo ABC (SMC ABC). While the system of ODEs describes the underlying process that generates the data, the observed measurements invariably include errors. In this paper, we argue that several popular ABC approaches fail to adequately model these errors because the acceptance probability depends on the choice of the discrepancy function and the tolerance without any consideration of the error term. We observe that the so-called posterior distributions derived from such methods do not accurately reflect the epistemic uncertainties in parameter values. Moreover, we demonstrate that these methods provide minimal computational advantages over exact Bayesian methods when applied to two ODE epidemiological models with simulated data and one with real data concerning malaria transmission in Afghanistan.},

@article{amigo-2003-math,
 abstract = {During the last years a new approach to construct safe block and stream ciphers has been developed using the theory of dynamical systems. Since a block cryptosystem is generally, from the mathematical point of view, a family (parametrized by the keys) of permutations of n-bit numbers, one of the main problems of this approach is to adapt the dynamics defined by a map f to the block structure of the cryptosystem. In this paper we propose a method based on the approximation of f by periodic maps Tn (v.g. some interval exchange transformations). The approximation of automorphisms of measure spaces by periodic automorphisms was introduced by Halmos and Rohlin. One important aspect studied in our paper is the relation between the dynamical properties of the map f (say, ergodicity or mixing) and the immunity of the resulting cipher to cryptolinear attacks, which is currently one of the standard benchmarks for cryptosystems to be considered secure. Linear cryptanalysis, first proposed by M. Matsui, exploits some statistical inhomogeneities of expressions called linear approximations for a given cipher. Our paper quantifies immunity to cryptolinear attacks in terms of the approximation speed of the map f by the periodic Tn. We show that the most resistant block ciphers are expected when the approximated dynamical system is mixing.},

Approximation of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems provides a comprehensive picture of model reduction, combining system theory with numerical linear algebra and computational considerations.

 abstract = {For nearly any challenging scientific problem evaluation of the likelihood is problematic if not impossible. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) allows us to employ the whole Bayesian formalism to problems where we can use simulations from a model, but cannot evaluate the likelihood directly. When summary statistics of real and simulated data are compared--rather than the data directly--information is lost, unless the summary statistics are sufficient. Sufficient statistics are, however, not common but without them statistical inference in ABC inferences are to be considered with caution. Previously other authors have attempted to combine different statistics in order to construct (approximately) sufficient statistics using search and information heuristics. Here we employ an information-theoretical framework that can be used to construct appropriate (approximately sufficient) statistics by combining different statistics until the loss of information is minimized. We start from a potentially large number of different statistics and choose the smallest set that captures (nearly) the same information as the complete set. We then demonstrate that such sets of statistics can be constructed for both parameter estimation and model selection problems, and we apply our approach to a range of illustrative and real-world model selection problems.},

@article{bauer-1994-math,
 abstract = {In clinical trials with an active control usually therapeutical equivalence of a new treatment is investigated by looking at a location parameter of the distributions of the primary efficacy variable. But even if the location parameters are close to each other existing differences in variability may be connected with different risks for under or over treatment in an individual patient.Assuming normally distributed responses a multiple test procedure applying two shifted one-sided t-tests for the mean and accordingly two one-sided F-tests for the variances is proposed. Equivalence in location and variability is established if all four tests lead to a rejection at the (one-sided) level alpha. A conservative procedure "correcting" the t-tests for heteroscedasticity is derived. The choice of a design in terms of the global level alpha, the global power, the relevant deviations in the population means and variances, as well as the sample size is outlined. Numerical calculations of the actual level and power for the proposed designs show, that for balanced sample sizes the classical uncorrected one-sided t-tests can be used safely without exaggerating the global type I error probability.Finally an example is given.},

 abstract = {We propose a new method for approximate Bayesian statistical inference on the basis of summary statistics. The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

The method fits naturally in the Bayesian inferential framework, and a brief overview is given of the key concepts. Three main approaches to ABC have been developed, and these are described and compared.

 abstract = {Sensitivity analysis helps decision-makers to understand how a given model output responds when there is variation in the model inputs. One of the most authoritative measures in global sensitivity analysis is the Sobol' total-order index ($T_i$), which can be computed with several different estimators. Although previous comparisons exist, it is hard to know which estimator performs best since the results are contingent on several benchmark settings: the sampling method ($\tau$), the distribution of the model inputs ($\phi$), the number of model runs ($N_t$), the test function or model ($\varepsilon$) and its dimensionality ($k$), the weight of higher order effects (e.g. second, third, $k_2,k_3$), or the performance measure selected ($\delta$). Here we break these limitations and simultaneously assess all total-order estimators in an eight-dimension hypercube where $(\tau, \phi, N_t, \varepsilon, k, k_2, k_3, \delta)$ are treated as random parameters. This design allows to create an unprecedentedly large range of benchmark scenarios. Our results indicate that, in general, the preferred estimator should be Razavi and Gupta's, followed by that of Jansen, or Janon/Monod. The remainder lag significantly behind in performance. Our work helps analysts navigate the myriad of total-order formulae by effectively eliminating the uncertainty in the selection of the best estimator.},

This approach allows one to quantify uncertainties (in fact, evolve the probability distribution) for nontrivial dynamical systems with equation-free modeling. We verify our approach on various examples, ranging from an inhomogeneous anisotropic stochastic differential equation on a torus, the chaotic Lorenz three-dimensional model, and the Nino-3.4 data set which is used as a proxy of the El Nino Southern Oscillation.},

Using an empirical Bayes approach, we provide a simple criterion for 1) choosing the threshold above which a simulation should be rejected, 2) choosing the subset of informative summary statistics, and 3) choosing if a summary statistic should be log-transformed or not.},

  abstract = {The interactions between individual pedestrians can lead to emergent effects, such as the formation of lanes in bidirectional flows. Here, we expose properties of an emergent effect at a macroscopic level, namely interactions between pedestrian streams that arise when pedestrians walk into and through four-way intersections from different directions. We propose non-spatial models for the number of pedestrians from different streams inside an intersection. Each model encodes a different hypothesis for how streams interact and can produce dynamics fundamentally distinct from the other models. By fitting our models to large experimental data sets and determining which model explains the data best, we determine when and how entire streams of pedestrians start to interact. We find that as arrival rates increase, streams start to interact and compete for space. Our results suggest that these interactions result in an even balance of pedestrian numbers across two orthogonally intersecting streams. Neither of the streams can dominate. In contrast, for four intersecting streams, our findings suggest that jams in some streams can coincide with higher flow rates in other streams and that the relative dominance of streams can switch stochastically. By adapting existing methodology, we thus present a coherent conceptual approach for investigating emergent effects in temporal dynamics at aggregated levels in pedestrian flows that could be applied to other scenarios. Our approach is flexible and uses easily measured quantities, making it highly suitable for observational data in different scenarios or deployment in applications.},

 abstract = {Complex nonlinear dynamics arise in many fields of science and engineering, but uncovering the underlying differential equations directly from observations poses a challenging task. The ability to symbolically model complex networked systems is key to understanding them, an open problem in many disciplines. Here we introduce for the first time a method that can automatically generate symbolic equations for a nonlinear coupled dynamical system directly from time series data. This method is applicable to any system that can be described using sets of ordinary nonlinear differential equations, and assumes that the (possibly noisy) time series of all variables are observable. Previous automated symbolic modeling approaches of coupled physical systems produced linear models or required a nonlinear model to be provided manually. The advance presented here is made possible by allowing the method to model each (possibly coupled) variable separately, intelligently perturbing and destabilizing the system to extract its less observable characteristics, and automatically simplifying the equations during modeling. We demonstrate this method on four simulated and two real systems spanning mechanics, ecology, and systems biology. Unlike numerical models, symbolic models have explanatory value, suggesting that automated "reverse engineering" approaches for model-free symbolic nonlinear system identification may play an increasing role in our ability to understand progressively more complex systems in the future.},

  abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

@article{bungartz-2004-math,
 abstract = {We present a survey of the fundamentals and the applications of sparse grids, with a focus on the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The sparse grid approach, introduced in Zenger (1991), is based on a higher-dimensional multiscale basis, which is derived from a one-dimensional multi-scale basis by a tensor product construction. Discretizations on sparse grids involve $O(N \cdot (\log N)^{d-1})$ degrees of freedom only, where $d$ denotes the underlying problem's dimensionality and where $N$ is the number of grid points in one coordinate direction at the boundary. The accuracy obtained with piecewise linear basis functions, for example, is $O(N^{-2} \cdot (\log N)^{d-1})$ with respect to the $L_{2^-}$ and $L_{\infty}$-norm, if the solution has bounded second mixed derivatives. This way, the curse of dimensionality, i.e., the exponential dependence $O(N^d)$ of conventional approaches, is overcome to some extent. For the energy norm, only $O(N)$ degrees of freedom are needed to give an accuracy of $O(N^{-1})$. That is why sparse grids are especially well-suited for problems of very high dimensionality. The sparse grid approach can be extended to nonsmooth solutions by adaptive refinement methods. Furthermore, it can be generalized from piecewise linear to higher-order polynomials. Also, more sophisticated basis functions like interpolets, prewavelets, or wavelets can be used in a straightforward way. We describe the basic features of sparse grids and report the results of various numerical experiments for the solution of elliptic PDEs as well as for other selected problems such as numerical quadrature and data mining.},

ABC is becoming the go-to option when the data and/or parameter dimension is large because it relies on user-chosen summary statistics rather than the full data and is therefore computationally feasible. One technical challenge with ABC is that the quality of the approximation to the posterior distribution of model parameters depends on the user-chosen summary statistics. In this paper, the user requirement to choose effective summary statistics in order to accurately estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters is investigated and illustrated by example, using a model and corresponding real data of mitochondrial DNA population dynamics. We show that for some choices of summary statistics, the posterior distribution of model parameters is closely approximated and for other choices of summary statistics, the posterior distribution is not closely approximated. A strategy to choose effective summary statistics is suggested in cases where the stochastic computer model can be run at many trial parameter settings, as in the example.},

 abstract = {Multiagent systems are rapidly finding applications in a variety of domains, including robotics, distributed control, telecommunications, and economics. The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors. The agents must, instead, discover a solution on their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multiagent learning concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multiagent learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can be distinguished: stability of the agents' learning dynamics, and adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL algorithms described in the literature aim---either explicitly or implicitly---at one of these two goals or at a combination of both, in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting. A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described along with some of the problem domains where the MARL techniques have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided.},

 abstract = {Abstract The Gauss-Newton with approximated tensors (GNAT) method is a nonlinear model-reduction method that operates on fully discretized computational models. It achieves dimension reduction by a Petrov-Galerkin projection associated with residual minimization; it delivers computational efficiency by a hyper-reduction procedure based on the 'gappy POD' technique. Originally presented in Ref. [1], where it was applied to implicit nonlinear structural-dynamics models, this method is further developed here and applied to the solution of a benchmark turbulent viscous flow problem. To begin, this paper develops global state-space error bounds that justify the method's design and highlight its advantages in terms of minimizing components of these error bounds. Next, the paper introduces a 'sample mesh' concept that enables a distributed, computationally efficient implementation of the \{GNAT\} method in finite-volume-based computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) codes. The suitability of \{GNAT\} for parameterized problems is highlighted with the solution of an academic problem featuring moving discontinuities. Finally, the capability of this method to reduce by orders of magnitude the core-hours required for large-scale \{CFD\} computations, while preserving accuracy, is demonstrated with the simulation of turbulent flow over the Ahmed body. For an instance of this benchmark problem with over 17 million degrees of freedom, \{GNAT\} outperforms several other nonlinear model-reduction methods, reduces the required computational resources by more than two orders of magnitude, and delivers a solution that differs by less than 1% from its high-dimensional counterpart.},

 abstract = {A major challenge in the study of dynamical systems is that of model discovery: turning data into models that are not just predictive, but provide insight into the nature of the underlying dynamical system that generated the data. This problem is made more difficult by the fact that many systems of interest exhibit diverse behaviors across multiple time scales. We introduce a number of datadriven strategies for discovering nonlinear multiscale dynamical systems and their embeddings from data. We consider two canonical cases: (i) systems for which we have full measurements of the governing variables and (ii) systems for which we have incomplete measurements. For systems with full state measurements, we show that the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems (SINDy) method can discover governing equations with relatively little data, provided that accurate measurements of the derivatives can be computed from the data. We introduce a sampling method that allows SINDy to scale efficiently to problems with multiple time scales; specifically, we can discover distinct governing equations at slow and fast scales. For systems with incomplete observations, we show that the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) method, based on time-delay embedding coordinates, can be used to obtain a linear model and Koopman invariant measurement system that nearly perfectly captures the dynamics of nonlinear quasiperiodic systems on the attractor. We introduce two strategies for using HAVOK on systems with multiple time scales. Together, our approaches provide a suite of mathematical strategies for reducing the data required to discover and model nonlinear multiscale systems.},

 abstract = {Many robotic applications require repeated, on-demand motion planning in mapped environments. In addition, the presence of other dynamic agents, such as people, often induces frequent, dynamic changes in the environment. Having a potential function that encodes pairwise cost-to-go can be useful for improving the computational speed of finding feasible paths, and for guiding local searches around dynamic obstacles. However, since storing pairwise potential can be impractical given the O(|V|2) memory requirement, existing work often needs to compute a potential function for each query to a new goal, which would require a substantial online computation. This work addresses the problem by using diffusion maps, a machine learning algorithm, to learn the map's geometry and develop a memory-efficient parametrization (O(|V|)) of pairwise potentials. Specially, each state in the map is transformed to a diffusion coordinate, in which pairwise Euclidean distance is shown to be a meaningful similarity metric. We develop diffusion-based motion planning algorithms and, through extensive numerical evaluation, show that the proposed algorithms find feasible paths of similar quality with orders of magnitude improvement in computational speed compared with single-query methods. The proposed algorithms are implemented on hardware to enable real-time autonomous navigation in an indoor environment with frequent interactions with pedestrians.},

 abstract = {The timely and secure evacuation of an urban residential community is crucial to residents' safety when emergency events happen. This is different to evacuation of office spaces or schools, emergency evacuation in residential communities must consider the pre-evacuation time. The importance of estimating evacuation time components has been recognized for approximately 40 years. However, pre-evacuation time is rarely discussed in previous community-scale emergency evacuation studies. This paper proposes a new method that estimates the pre-evacuation time, which makes the evacuation simulation in urban residential communities more realistic. This method integrates the residents' pre-evacuation behavior data obtained by surveys to explore the influencing factors of pre-evacuation time and builds a predictive model to forecast pre-evacuation times based on the Random Forest algorithm. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to find the critical parameters in evacuation simulations. The results of evacuation simulations in different scenarios can be compared to identify potential evacuation problems. A case study in Luoshanqicun Community, Pudong New District, Shanghai, China, was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. The simulation results showed that the pre-evacuation times have significant impacts on the simulation procedure, including the total evacuation time, the congestion time and the congestion degree. This study can help to gain a deeper understanding of residents' behaviors under emergencies and improve emergency managements of urban communities.},

@article{chiavazzo-2014-math,
 abstract = {The adoption of detailed mechanisms for chemical kinetics often poses two types of severe challenges: First, the number of degrees of freedom is large; and second, the dynamics is characterized by widely disparate time scales. As a result, reactive flow solvers with detailed chemistry often become intractable even for large clusters of CPUs, especially when dealing with direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent combustion problems. This has motivated the development of several techniques for reducing the complexity of such kinetics models, where eventually only a few variables are considered in the development of the simplified model. Unfortunately, no generally applicable a priori recipe for selecting suitable parameterizations of the reduced model is available, and the choice of slow variables often relies upon intuition and experience. We present an automated approach to this task, consisting of three main steps. First, the low dimensional manifold of slow motions is (approximately) sampled by brief simulations of the detailed model, starting from a rich enough ensemble of admissible initial conditions. Second, a global parameterization of the manifold is obtained through the Diffusion Map (DMAP) approach, which has recently emerged as a powerful tool in data analysis/machine learning. Finally, a simplified model is constructed and solved on the fly in terms of the above reduced (slow) variables. Clearly, closing this latter model requires nontrivial interpolation calculations, enabling restriction (mapping from the full ambient space to the reduced one) and lifting (mapping from the reduced space to the ambient one). This is a key step in our approach, and a variety of interpolation schemes are reported and compared. The scope of the proposed procedure is presented and discussed by means of an illustrative combustion example.},

@article{coifman-2008-math,
 abstract = {The concise representation of complex high dimensional stochastic systems via a few reduced coordinates is an important problem in computational physics, chemistry, and biology. In this paper we use the first few eigenfunctions of the backward Fokker-Planck diffusion operator as a coarse-grained low dimensional representation for the long-term evolution of a stochastic system and show that they are optimal under a certain mean squared error criterion. We denote the mapping from physical space to these eigenfunctions as the diffusion map. While in high dimensional systems these eigenfunctions are difficult to compute numerically by conventional methods such as finite differences or finite elements, we describe a simple computational data-driven method to approximate them from a large set of simulated data. Our method is based on defining an appropriately weighted graph on the set of simulated data and computing the first few eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the corresponding random walk matrix on this graph. Thus, our algorithm incorporates the local geometry and density at each point into a global picture that merges data from different simulation runs in a natural way. Furthermore, we describe lifting and restriction operators between the diffusion map space and the original space. These operators facilitate the description of the coarse-grained dynamics, possibly in the form of a low dimensional effective free energy surface parameterized by the diffusion map reduction coordinates. They also enable a systematic exploration of such effective free energy surfaces through the design of additional "intelligently biased" computational experiments. We conclude by demonstrating our method in a few examples.},

 abstract = {Many multivariate functions in engineering models vary primarily along a few directions in the space of input parameters. When these directions correspond to coordinate directions, one may apply global sensitivity measures to determine the most influential parameters. However, these methods perform poorly when the directions of variability are not aligned with the natural coordinates of the input space. We present a method to first detect the directions of the strongest variability using evaluations of the gradient and subsequently exploit these directions to construct a response surface on a low-dimensional subspace---i.e., the active subspace---of the inputs. We develop a theoretical framework with error bounds, and we link the theoretical quantities to the parameters of a kriging response surface on the active subspace. We apply the method to an elliptic PDE model with coefficients parameterized by 100 Gaussian random variables and compare it with a local sensitivity analysis method for dimension reduction.},

 abstract = {Predictions from science and engineering models depend on several input parameters. Global sensitivity analysis quantifies the importance of each input parameter, which can lead to insight into the model and reduced computational cost; commonly used sensitivity metrics include Sobol' total sensitivity indices and derivative-based global sensitivity measures. Active subspaces are part of an emerging set of tools for identifying important directions in a model's input parameter space; these directions can be exploited to reduce the model's dimension enabling otherwise infeasible parameter studies. In this paper, we develop global sensitivity metrics called activity scores from the active subspace, which yield insight into the important model parameters. We mathematically relate the activity scores to established sensitivity metrics, and we discuss computational methods to estimate the activity scores. We show two numerical examples with algebraic functions taken from simplified engineering models. For each model, we analyze the active subspace and discuss how to exploit the low-dimensional structure. We then show that input rankings produced by the activity scores are consistent with rankings produced by the standard metrics.},

Motivated by the growth in computational power and data complexity, modern approaches to this question make intensive use of simulation methods. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is one of these methods. Here we review the foundations of ABC, its recent algorithmic developments, and its applications in evolutionary biology and ecology. We argue that the use of ABC should incorporate all aspects of Bayesian data analysis: formulation, fitting, and improvement of a model. ABC can be a powerful tool to make inferences with complex models if these principles are carefully applied.},

The model is constructed from a set of particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements, using the velocity field data obtained in previous experiments. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is as a technique which allows the extraction of the significant modes of a flow. It permits to identify modes without any a priori hypothesis, and these are ordered by their associated level of energy. The POD modes are used to formulate a dynamical system which only contains the main features of the flow, a low order dynamical system(LODS). This is achieved by means of a Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes Equations with the goal to obtain a system of ordinary differential equations describing the main aspects of the flow without demanding excessive computational requirements.},

 abstract = {In August 2011, several areas of London experienced episodes of large-scale disorder, comprising looting, rioting and violence. Much subsequent discourse has questioned the adequacy of the police response, in terms of the resources available and strategies used. In this article, we present a mathematical model of the spatial development of the disorder, which can be used to examine the effect of varying policing arrangements. The model is capable of simulating the general emergent patterns of the events and focusses on three fundamental aspects: the apparently-contagious nature of participation; the distances travelled to riot locations; and the deterrent effect of policing. We demonstrate that the spatial configuration of London places some areas at naturally higher risk than others, highlighting the importance of spatial considerations when planning for such events. We also investigate the consequences of varying police numbers and reaction time, which has the potential to guide policy in this area.},

Our approach is based on empirical interpolation of nonlinear differential operators and their Frechet derivatives. Efficient offline/online decomposition is obtained for discrete operators that allow an efficient evaluation for a certain set of interpolation functionals. An a posteriori error estimate for the resulting reduced basis method is derived and analyzed numerically. The approach is applied to nonlinear parabolic and hyperbolic equations based on explicit or implicit finite volume discretizations.We show that the resulting reduced scheme is able to capture the evolution of both smooth and discontinuous solutions. In case of symmetries of the problem, the approach realizes an automatic and intuitive space-compression or even space-dimensionality reduction. We perform empirical investigations of the error convergence and runtimes. In all cases we obtain a good runtime acceleration that grows with the problem's size.},

 abstract = {The movement of many organisms can be described as a random walk at either or both the individual and population level. The rules for this random walk are based on complex biological processes and it may be difficult to develop a tractable, quantitatively-accurate, individual-level model. However, important problems in areas ranging from ecology to medicine involve large collections of individuals, and a further intellectual challenge is to model population-level behavior based on a detailed individual-level model. Because of the large number of interacting individuals and because the individual-level model is complex, classical direct Monte Carlo simulations can be very slow, and often of little practical use. In this case, an equation-free approach [I.G. Kevrekidis, C.W. Gear, J.M. Hyman, P. Kevrekidis, O. Runborg, K. Theodoropoulos, Equation-free, coarse-grained multiscale computation: enabling microscopic simulators to perform system-level analysis, Commun. Math. Sci. 1 (4) (2003) 715-762] may provide effective methods for the analysis and simulation of individual-based models. In this paper we analyze equation-free coarse projective integration. For analytical purposes, we start with known partial differential equations describing biological random walks and we study the projective integration of these equations. In particular, we illustrate how to accelerate explicit numerical methods for solving these equations. Then we present illustrative kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of these random walks and show that a decrease in computational time by as much as a factor of a thousand can be obtained by exploiting the ideas developed by analysis of the closed form PDEs. The illustrative biological example here is chemotaxis, but it could be any random walker that biases its movement in response to environmental cues.},

 abstract = {Finding coarse-grained, low-dimensional descriptions is an important task in the analysis of complex, stochastic models of gene regulatory networks. This task involves (a) identifying observables that best describe the state of these complex systems and (b) characterizing the dynamics of the observables. In a previous paper [R. Erban et al., J. Chem. Phys.124, 084106 (2006)] the authors assumed that good observables were known a priori, and presented an equation-free approach to approximate coarse-grained quantities (i.e., effective drift and diffusion coefficients) that characterize the long-time behavior of the observables. Here we use diffusion maps [R. Coifman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

  abstract    = {In structural optimization, usually an approximation concept is introduced as interface between (FEM) structural analysis code and optimization algorithm. In some cases of optimum design, a global approximation concept can be effectively applied. Then, approximation model functions are built of all objective and constraint functions, whose values, for a certain design point, follow from the structural analysis calculations. In this way, the original optimization problem is completely replaced by an explicitly known approximate optimization problem. Response-surface techniques are commonly applied to build global approximation models, especially when dealing with responses of physical experiments. For one response function, this means that a user defined model function is fitted to the response data calculated at the design sites of some experimental design. Errors between model function and experimental response values are assumed to be randomly distributed. However, in the structural optimization case, an experiment is a computer analysis with a deterministic response as a result. This rules out the statistical assumptions response-surface model building is based upon. Furthermore, it is often diffcult to find model functions that approximate the true response behaviour within the desired accuracy. Sacks and coworkers proposed a new model building strategy, that is especially suited for deterministic computer responses. Their basic assumption is that computer responses can be modelled as a realization of a stochastic process. This finally leads to a response prediction that exactly describes all calculated computer responses. Additionally, the mean squared error of a prediction can be calculated, which serves as a measure of accuracy of the prediction. A review is given of the method of Sacks et al.. It has been implemented in MATLAB. Some analytical response functions and small design optimization problems have been used to test the model building capacities and the effectiveness of the method when applied as global approximation concept in structural optimization. It is concluded that the strategy as proposed by Sacks and coworkers is not suited for implementation in a design optimization tool, mainly because of two reasons. Firstly, maximum likelihood parameter estimation is computationally expensive and not straightforward, while the quality of the parameter estimations is questionable. This computational effort is disadvantageous if many constraint functions have to approximated, which often occurs in structural optimization. Secondly, the mean squared error can not be unconditionally trusted. To have an independent accuracy measure several additional computer experiments (test points) have to be performed. Main advantage of the approximations of Sacks et al., compared with response-surface models, is the exibility to automatically adapt to the calculated response data. The same sort of exibility also occurs for the moving least-squares variant of the least-squares parameter estimation. It is recommended to investigate whether this method can add exibility to, and solve the model function selection problems of, the response-surface strategy without an unmanageable amount of computations.},

  abstract = {Many modern statistical applications involve inference for complex stochastic models, where it is easy to simulate from the models, but impossible to calculate likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a method of inference for such models. It replaces calculation of the likelihood by a step which involves simulating artificial data for different parameter values, and comparing summary statistics of the simulated data with summary statistics of the observed data. Here we show how to construct appropriate summary statistics for ABC in a semi-automatic manner. We aim for summary statistics which will enable inference about certain parameters of interest to be as accurate as possible. Theoretical results show that optimal summary statistics are the posterior means of the parameters. Although these cannot be calculated analytically, we use an extra stage of simulation to estimate how the posterior means vary as a function of the data; and we then use these estimates of our summary statistics within ABC. Empirical results show that our approach is a robust method for choosing summary statistics that can result in substantially more accurate ABC analyses than the ad hoc choices of summary statistics that have been proposed in the literature. We also demonstrate advantages over two alternative methods of simulation-based inference.},

The locomotion mode is closer to a pure traveling waveform than the steering mode. The characteristic wavelength of the primary mode was estimated in the complex plane.

 abstract = {Multi-agent settings are quickly gathering importance in machine learning. This includes a plethora of recent work on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, but also can be extended to hierarchical reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks and decentralised optimisation. In all these settings the presence of multiple learning agents renders the training problem non-stationary and often leads to unstable training or undesired final results. We present Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), a method in which each agent shapes the anticipated learning of the other agents in the environment. The LOLA learning rule includes an additional term that accounts for the impact of one agent's policy on the anticipated parameter update of the other agents. Preliminary results show that the encounter of two LOLA agents leads to the emergence of tit-for-tat and therefore cooperation in the iterated prisoners' dilemma (IPD), while independent learning does not. In this domain, LOLA also receives higher payouts compared to a naive learner, and is robust against exploitation by higher order gradient-based methods. Applied to infinitely repeated matching pennies, LOLA agents converge to the Nash equilibrium. In a round robin tournament we show that LOLA agents can successfully shape the learning of a range of multi-agent learning algorithms from literature, resulting in the highest average returns on the IPD. We also show that the LOLA update rule can be efficiently calculated using an extension of the likelihood ratio policy gradient estimator, making the method suitable for model-free reinforcement learning. This method thus scales to large parameter and input spaces and nonlinear function approximators. We also apply LOLA to a grid world task with an embedded social dilemma using deep recurrent policies and opponent modelling. Again, by explicitly considering the learning of the other agent, LOLA agents learn to cooperate out of self-interest.},

If an alternative, microscopic (e.g. Monte Carlo or Lattice Boltzmann) description of the physics is available, we illustrate how this microscopic simulator can be enabled (through a computational superstructure) to perform certain integration and numerical bifurcation analysis tasks directly at the coarse, systems level. This approach, when successful, can circumvent the derivation of accurate, closed form, macroscopic \{PDE\} descriptions of the system. The direct 'systems level' analysis of microscopic process models, facilitated through such numerical enabling technologies, may, if practical, advance our understanding and use of nonequilibrium systems.},

 abstract = {We consider dynamical systems possessing an attracting, invariant "slow manifold" that can be parameterized by a few observable variables. We present a procedure that, given a process for integrating the system step by step and a set of values of the observables, finds the values of the remaining system variables such that the state is close to the slow manifold to some desired accuracy. It should be noted that this is not equivalent to "integrating down to the manifold" since the latter process may significantly change the values of the observables. We consider problems whose solution has a singular perturbation expansion, although we do not know what it is nor have any way to compute it (because the system is not necessarily expressed in a singular perturbation form). We show in this paper that, under some conditions, computing the values of the remaining variables so that their (m + 1)st time derivatives are zero provides an estimate of the unknown variables that is an mth-order approximation to a point on the slow manifold in a sense to be defined. We then show how this criterion can be applied approximately when the system is defined by a legacy code rather than directly through closed form equations. This procedure can be valuable when one wishes to start a simulation of the detailed model on the slow manifold with particular values of observable variables characterizing the slow manifold.},

  abstract = {We develop a framework for dimension reduction, mode decomposition, and nonparametric forecasting of data generated by ergodic dynamical systems. This framework is based on a representation of the Koopman and Perron{\textendash}Frobenius groups of unitary operators in a smooth orthonormal basis of the L2 space of the dynamical system, acquired from time-ordered data through the diffusion maps algorithm. Using this representation, we compute Koopman eigenfunctions through a regularized advection{\textendash}diffusion operator, and employ these eigenfunctions in dimension reduction maps with projectible dynamics and high smoothness for the given observation modality. In systems with pure point spectra, we construct a decomposition of the generator of the Koopman group into mutually commuting vector fields that transform naturally under changes of observation modality, which we reconstruct in data space through a representation of the pushforward map in the Koopman eigenfunction basis. We also establish a correspondence between Koopman operators and Laplace{\textendash}Beltrami operators constructed from data in Takens delaycoordinate space, and use this correspondence to provide an interpretation of diffusion-mapped delay coordinates for this class of systems. Moreover, we take advantage of a special property of the Koopman eigenfunction basis, namely that the basis elements evolve as simple harmonic oscillators, to build nonparametric forecast models for probability densities and observables. In systems with more complex spectral behavior, including mixing systems, we develop a method inspired from time change in dynamical systems to transform the generator to a new operator with potentially improved spectral properties, and use that operator for vector field decomposition and nonparametric forecasting.},

@article{givon-2004-math,
 abstract = {In many applications, the primary objective of numerical simulation of time-evolving systems is the prediction of coarse-grained, or macroscopic, quantities. The purpose of this review is twofold: first, to describe a number of simple model systems where the coarse-grained or macroscopic behaviour of a system can be explicitly determined from the full, or microscopic, description; and second, to overview some of the emerging algorithmic approaches that have been introduced to extract effective, lower-dimensional, macroscopic dynamics. The model problems we describe may be either stochastic or deterministic in both their microscopic and macroscopic behaviour, leading to four possibilities in the transition from microscopic to macroscopic descriptions. Model problems are given which illustrate all four situations, and mathematical tools for their study are introduced. These model problems are useful in the evaluation of algorithms. We use specific instances of the model problems to illustrate these algorithms. As the subject of algorithm development and analysis is, in many cases, in its infancy, the primary purpose here is to attempt to unify some of the emerging ideas so that individuals new to the field have a structured access to the literature. Furthermore, by discussing the algorithms in the context of the model problems, a platform for understanding existing algorithms and developing new ones is built.},

 abstract = {Recent decades have seen enormous improvements in computational inference for statistical models; there have been competitive continual enhancements in a wide range of computational tools. In Bayesian inference, first and foremost, MCMC techniques have continued to evolve, moving from random walk proposals to Langevin drift, to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and so on, with both theoretical and algorithmic innovations opening new opportunities to practitioners. However, this impressive evolution in capacity is confronted by an even steeper increase in the complexity of the datasets to be addressed. The difficulties of modelling and then handling ever more complex datasets most likely call for a new type of tool for computational inference that dramatically reduces the dimension and size of the raw data while capturing its essential aspects. Approximate models and algorithms may thus be at the core of the next computational revolution.},

 abstract = {Statistical models are the traditional choice to test scientific theories when observations, processes or boundary conditions are subject to stochasticity. Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.},

The key research question addressed in this paper is how to learn planners that generate human-like motion behavior. Our approach uses inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to learn human-like navigation behavior based on example paths. Since robots have only limited sensing, we extend existing IRL methods to the case of partially observable environments. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach using a realistic crowd flow simulator in which we modeled multiple scenarios in crowded environments. We show that our planner learned to guide the robot along the flow of people when the environment is crowded, and along the shortest path if no people are around.},

 abstract = {The present paper deals with a new method of global sensitivity analysis of
nonlinear models. This is based on a measure of importance to calculate the
fractional contribution of the input parameters to the variance of the model
prediction. Measures of importance in sensitivity analysis have been suggested
by several authors, whose work is reviewed in this article. More emphasis is
given to the developments of sensitivity indices by the Russian mathematician
I.M. Sobol'. Given that Sobol' treatment of the measure of importance is the
most general, his formalism is employed throughout this paper where
conceptual and computational improvements of the method are presented.
The computational novelty of this study is the introduction of the 'total effect'
parameter index. This index provides a measure of the total effect of a given
parameter, including all the possible synergetic terms between that parameter
and all the others. Rank transformation of the data is also introduced in order
to increase the reproducibility of the method. These methods are tested on a
few analytical and computer models. The main conclusion of this work is the
identification of a sensitivity analysis methodology which is both flexible,
accurate and informative, and which can be achieved at reasonable computational
cost.},

@inproceedings{hosder-2007-math,
 abstract = {The accuracy and the computational efficiency of a Point-Collocation Non-Intrusive Polynomial Chaos (NIPC) method applied to stochastic problems with multiple uncertain input variables has been investigated. Two stochastic model problems with multiple uniform random variables were studied to determine the effect of different sampling methods (Random, Latin Hypercube, and Hammersley) for the selection of the collocation points. The effect of the number of collocation points on the accuracy of polynomial chaos expansions were also investigated. The results of the stochastic model problems show that all three sampling methods exhibit a similar performance in terms of the the accuracy and the computational efficiency of the chaos expansions. It has been observed that using a number of collocation points that is twice more than the minimum number required gives a better approximation to the statistics at each polynomial degree. This improvement can be related to the increase of the accuracy of the polynomial coefficients due to the use of more information in their calculation. The results of the stochastic model problems also indicate that for problems with multiple random variables, improving the accuracy of polynomial chaos coefficients in NIPC approaches may reduce the computational expense by achieving the same accuracy level with a lower order polynomial expansion. To demonstrate the application of Point-Collocation NIPC to an aerospace problem with multiple uncertain input variables, a stochastic computational aerodynamics problem which includes the numerical simulation of steady, inviscid, transonic flow over a three-dimensional wing with an uncertain free-stream Mach number and angle of attack has been studied. For this study, a 5th degree Point-Collocation NIPC expansion obtained with Hammersley sampling was capable of estimating the statistics at an accuracy level of 1000 Latin Hypercube Monte Carlo simulations with a significantly lower computational cost.},

  abstract  = {Phenotypic differences of genetically identical cells under the same environmental conditions have been attributed to the inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes. Various mechanisms have been suggested, including the existence of alternative steady states in regulatory networks that are reached by means of stochastic fluctuations, long transient excursions from a stable state to an unstable excited state, and the switching on and off of a reaction network according to the availability of a constituent chemical species. Here we analyse a detailed stochastic kinetic model of two-component system signalling in bacteria, and show that alternative phenotypes emerge in the absence of these features. We perform a bifurcation analysis of deterministic reaction rate equations derived from the model, and find that they cannot reproduce the whole range of qualitative responses to external signals demonstrated by direct stochastic simulations. In particular, the mixed mode, where stochastic switching and a graded response are seen simultaneously, is absent. However, probabilistic and equation-free analyses of the stochastic model that calculate stationary states for the mean of an ensemble of stochastic trajectories reveal that slow transcription of either response regulator or histidine kinase leads to the coexistence of an approximate basal solution and a graded response that combine to produce the mixed mode, thus establishing its essential stochastic nature. The same techniques also show that stochasticity results in the observation of an all-or-none bistable response over a much wider range of external signals than would be expected on deterministic grounds. Thus we demonstrate the application of numerical equation-free methods to a detailed biochemical reaction network model, and show that it can provide new insight into the role of stochasticity in the emergence of phenotypic diversity.},

The objective of the present study is to investigate the applicability of three widely used techniques to three computer models having large uncertainties and varying degrees of complexity in order to highlight some of the problem areas that must be addressed in actual applications. The following approaches to uncertainty and sensitivity analysis are considered: (1) response surface methodology based on input determined from a fractional factorial design; (2) Latin hypercube sampling with and without regression analysis; and (3) differential analysis. These techniques are investigated with respect to (1) ease of implementation, (2) flexibility, (3) estimation of the cumulative distribution function of the output, and (4) adaptability to different methods of sensitivity analysis. With respect to these criteria, the technique using Latin hypercube sampling and regression analysis had the best overall performance. The models used in the investigation are well documented, thus making it possible for researchers to make comparisons of other techniques with the results in this study.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

This quantity can be for instance the variance of an output variable. Three kinds of methods are distinguished: the screening (coarse sorting of the most influential inputs among a large number), the measures of importance (quantitative sensitivity indices) and the deep exploration of the model behaviour (measuring the effects of inputs on their all variation range). A progressive application methodology is illustrated on a scholar application.

Effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated in a comparative study by applying the technique and a conventional regression method to two computer models, an analytical model and the TERFOC model.},

The composition of the variance of Y is considered; variance components of particular relevance for uncertainty analysis are identified. Several analysis of variance designs for estimation of these variance components are discussed. Classical normal-model theory can suggest optimal designs. The designs can be implemented with various sampling methods: ordinary random sampling, latin hypercube sampling and scrambled quasi-random sampling. Some combinations of design and sampling method are compared in two small-scale numerical experiments.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in Bayesian hypothesis testing have led to the development of uniformly most powerful Bayesian tests, which represent an objective, default class of Bayesian hypothesis tests that have the same rejection regions as classical significance tests. Based on the correspondence between these two classes of tests, it is possible to equate the size of classical hypothesis tests with evidence thresholds in Bayesian tests, and to equate P values with Bayes factors. An examination of these connections suggest that recent concerns over the lack of reproducibility of scientific studies can be attributed largely to the conduct of significance tests at unjustifiably high levels of significance. To correct this problem, evidence thresholds required for the declaration of a significant finding should be increased to 25-50:1, and to 100-200:1 for the declaration of a highly significant finding. In terms of classical hypothesis tests, these evidence standards mandate the conduct of tests at the 0.005 or 0.001 level of significance.},

The new model can capture large scale structures, while retaining microscopic information on intermolecular forces and particle fluctuations. The requirement of detailed balance is utilized as a systematic design principle to guarantee correct noise fluctuations for the coarse-grained model. We carry out a rigorous asymptotic analysis of the new system using techniques from large deviations and present detailed numerical comparisons of coarse-grained and microscopic Monte Carlo simulations. The coarse-grained stochastic algorithms provide large computational savings without increasing programming complexity or the CPU time per executed event compared to microscopic Monte Carlo simulations.},

@article{kuenzner-2019-math,
 abstract = {To foster predictive simulations, a variety of methods have recently been developed to efficiently tackle uncertainty quantification (UQ) in complex, computational intensive problems. Many of these methods are non-intrusive and, thus, result in a (large) number of embarrassingly parallel black-box evaluations of the underlying simulation codes. While the focus of development is typically on the number of black-box evaluations, which represents the bulk of the computational workload, an additional level of potential performance gains exists. In many scenarios, uncertain input leads not only to uncertain outputs, but also to a varying and thus stochastic runtime of the simulation codes. For scheduling the individual black-box runs, this information is typically not taken into account, resulting in non-negligible idling times on parallel systems. In this contribution, we compare a variety of different scheduling strategies for non-intrusive UQ scenarios using the non-intrusive polynomial chaos approach. In particular, we propose to construct a surrogate model for the runtime of the application using the identical UQ methodology as for the original problem. Using this model to predict the runtimes for subsequent black-box runs allows for (heuristical) optimization of the scheduling. The method has been tested for the forward quantification of uncertainty on academic models and on a pedestrian simulation in the context of evacuation scenarios. This approach allows speed-up factors of about two for the total runtime and can be generalised to a large variety of applications that incorporate parameter-dependent runtime.},

 abstract = {Learning goal-directed behavior in environments with sparse feedback is a major challenge for reinforcement learning algorithms. One of the key difficulties is insufficient exploration, resulting in an agent being unable to learn robust policies. Intrinsically motivated agents can explore new behavior for their own sake rather than to directly solve external goals. Such intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present hierarchical-DQN (h-DQN), a framework to integrate hierarchical action-value functions, operating at different temporal scales, with goal-driven intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top-level q-value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals, while a lower-level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h-DQN allows for flexible goal specifications, such as functions over entities and relations. This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse and delayed feedback: (1) a complex discrete stochastic decision process with stochastic transitions, and (2) the classic ATARI game -- `Montezuma's Revenge'.},

Recently, Sobol and Kucherenko have proposed the derivative-based global sensitivity measures (DGSM), defined as the integral of the squared derivatives of the model output, showing that it can help to solve the problem of dimensionality in some cases. We provide a general inequality link between DGSM and total Sobol indices for input variables belonging to the class of Boltzmann probability measures, thus extending the previous results of Sobol and Kucherenko for uniform and normal measures. The special case of log-concave measures is also described. This link provides a DGSM-based maximal bound for the total Sobol indices. Numerical tests show the performance of the bound and its usefulness in practice.},

The performance of the method is tested using experimental data obtained in the near field of a zero-net-mass-flux (ZNMF) jet. The better performance of HODMD is put in evidence making this technique suitable to both, cleaning the experimental noise using a limited number of snapshots and obtaining robust and sufficiently accurate results that elucidate the spatio-temporal structure of the flow. The results show that this ZNMF jet is temporally periodic in the near field, where the flow results from the interaction of a large number harmonics. These harmonics involve large scale spatial flow structures, identified as spatially growing instabilities, which are associated with the flow transition to turbulence in the far field.},

FE can very well simulate continuum mechanics (CM) problems, but has the limitation of the lack of atomistic level degrees of freedom. Multiscale modeling is an expedient methodology with a potential to connect different levels of modeling such as quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics, and continuum mechanics. This study proposes a new multiscale modeling technique to couple MD with FE. The proposed method relies on weighted average momentum principle. A wave propagation example has been used to illustrate the challenges in coupling MD with FE and to verify the proposed technique. Furthermore, 2-Dimensional problem has also been used to demonstrate how this method would translate into real world applications.},

Recently, deep neural networks have successfully been applied to games with discrete actions spaces. However, deep neural networks for discrete actions are not suitable for devising strategies for games where a very small change in an action can dramatically affect the outcome. In this paper, we present a new self-play reinforcement learning framework which equips a continuous search algorithm which enables to search in continuous action spaces with a kernel regression method. Without any hand-crafted features, our network is trained by supervised learning followed by self-play reinforcement learning with a high-fidelity simulator for the Olympic sport of curling. The program trained under our framework outperforms existing programs equipped with several hand-crafted features and won an international digital curling competition.},

@article{li-2003-math,
 abstract = {Recent developments in multiscale computation allow the solution of ``coarse equations'' for the expected macroscopic behavior of microscopically/stochastically evolving particle distributions without ever obtaining these coarse equations in closed form. The closure is obtained ``on demand'' through appropriately initialized bursts of microscopic simulation. The effective coupling of microscopic simulators with macrosocopic behavior embodied in this approach requires certain decisions about the nature of the unavailable ``coarse equation''. Such decisions include (a) the determination of the highest spatial derivative active in the equation, (b) whether the coarse equation satisfies certain conservation laws, and (c) whether the coarse dynamics is Hamiltonian. These decisions affect the number and type of boundary conditions as well as the nature of the algorithms employed in good solution practice. In the absence of an explicit formula for the temporal derivative, we propose, implement and validate a simple scheme for deciding these and other similar questions about the coarse equation using only the microscopic simulator. Microscopic simulations under periodic boundary conditions are carried out for appropriately chosen families of random initial conditions; evaluating the sample variance of certain statistics over the simulation ensemble allows us to infer the highest order of spatial derivatives active in the coarse equation. In the same spirit we show how to determine whether a certain coarse conservation law exists or not, and we discuss plausibility tests for the existence of a coarse Hamiltonian or integrability. We argue that such schemes constitute an important part of the equation-free approach to multiscale computation.},

It provides a principled framework for dealing with uncertainty and quantifying how it changes in the light of new evidence. For many complex models and inference problems, however, only approximate quantitative answers are obtainable. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) refers to a family of algorithms for approximate inference that makes a minimal set of assumptions by only requiring that sampling from a model is possible. We explain here the fundamentals of ABC, review the classical algorithms, and highlight recent developments.

 abstract = {A quantitative description of a complex system is inherently limited by our ability to estimate the system's internal state from experimentally accessible outputs. Although the simultaneous measurement of all internal variables, like all metabolite concentrations in a cell, offers a complete description of a system's state, in practice experimental access is limited to only a subset of variables, or sensors. A system is called observable if we can reconstruct the system's complete internal state from its outputs. Here, we adopt a graphical approach derived from the dynamical laws that govern a system to determine the sensors that are necessary to reconstruct the full internal state of a complex system. We apply this approach to biochemical reaction systems, finding that the identified sensors are not only necessary but also sufficient for observability. The developed approach can also identify the optimal sensors for target or partial observability, helping us reconstruct selected state variables from appropriately chosen outputs, a prerequisite for optimal biomarker design. Given the fundamental role observability plays in complex systems, these results offer avenues to systematically explore the dynamics of a wide range of natural, technological and socioeconomic systems.},

Second, we apply this result to study the idealized traffic modeling problem of phantom jams generated by cars with uniform behavior on a circular road. It is shown, that the implicitly defined coarse-level time stepper converges to the true dynamics on the slow manifold with an accuracy that is beyond all orders of the small parameter measuring time scale separation. These results are applied to investigate the behavior of the microscopic traffic model on a macroscopic level. The traffic jams are waves that travel slowly and in opposite direction compared to the car velocity. The standard deviation is chosen as a macroscopic measure of traveling wave solutions and is continued on the macroscopic level in the equation-free setup. The collapse of the traffic jam to the free flow corresponds in the relevant parameter region at the macroscopic level to a saddle-node bifurcation of the traveling wave. We continue this bifurcation point in two parameters using equation-free analysis.},

@article{martinez-gil-2015-math,
 abstract = {In this paper, a new multi-agent reinforcement learning approach is introduced for the simulation of pedestrian groups. Unlike other solutions, where the behaviors of the pedestrians are coded in the system, in our approach the agents learn by interacting with the environment. The embodied agents must learn to control their velocity, avoiding obstacles and the other pedestrians, to reach a goal inside the scenario. The main contribution of this paper is to propose this new methodology that uses different iterative learning strategies, combining a vector quantization (state space generalization) with the Q-learning algorithm (VQQL). Two algorithmic schemas, Iterative VQQL and Incremental, which differ in the way of addressing the problems, have been designed and used with and without transfer of knowledge. These algorithms are tested and compared with the VQQL algorithm as a baseline in two scenarios where agents need to solve well-known problems in pedestrian modeling. In the first, agents in a closed room need to reach the unique exit producing and solving a bottleneck. In in the second, two groups of agents inside a corridor need to reach their goal that is placed in opposite sides (they need to solve the crossing). In the first scenario, we focus on scalability, use metrics from the pedestrian modeling field, and compare with the Helbing's social force model. The emergence of collective behaviors, that is, the shell-shaped clogging in front of the exit in the first scenario, and the lane formation as a solution to the problem of the crossing, have been obtained and analyzed. The results demonstrate that the proposed schemas find policies that carry out the tasks, suggesting that they are applicable and generalizable to the simulation of pedestrians groups.},

 abstract = {The semi-variogram is central to geostatistics and the single most important tool in geo-statistical applications to soil. Mathematical functions for semi-variograms must be conditional negative semi-definite, and there are only a few families of simple function that meet this demand. These include the transitive models with finite a priori variance deriving from moving average processes. The spherical and exponential schemes are the most often encountered members. The other major group is that of unbounded models in which the variance appears to increase without limit. The linear model is the most common in this group. If more complex models are needed they can be formed by combining two or more simple models. The usual estimator of the semi-variance is often considered inefficient and to be sensitive to departures from normality in the data. It is compared with a robust estimator and shown to be generally preferable in being unbiased and having confidence intervals that are no wider. For routine analysis, fitting models to sample semi-variograms by weighted least squares approximation, with weights proportional to the expected semi-variance, is preferred to the more elaborate and computationally demanding statistical procedures of generalized least squares and maximum likelihood. The Akaike information criterion is recommended for selecting the best model from several plausible ones to describe the observed variation in soil, though for kriging it may be desirable to validate the chosen model. Examples of models fitted to soil semi-variograms are shown and compared.},

Motivation for this article comes from computational models that are deterministic, complicated enough to make classical mathematical analysis impractical and that have a moderate-to-large number of inputs. The problem of designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

The method, superficially, is relatively simple to implement, and is slowly gaining industrial acceptance. Unfortunately, very little has been published on how the method works. To those who are uninitiated, this powerful approach remains a black art. This paper demonstrates that the Monte Carlo simulation method is fully compatible with the conventional uncertainty estimation methods for linear systems and systems that have small uncertainties. Monte Carlo simulation has the ability to take account of partial correlated measurement input uncertainties. It also examines the uncertainties of the results of some basic manipulations e.g. addition, multiplication and division, of two input measured variables which may or may not be correlated. For correlated input measurements, the probability distribution of the result could be biased or skewed. These properties cannot be revealed using conventional methods.},

 abstract = {Methane gas hydrates have increasingly become a topic of interest because of their potential as a future energy resource. There are significant economical and environmental risks associated with extraction from hydrate reservoirs, so a variety of multiphysics models have been developed to analyze prospective risks and benefits. These models generally have a large number of empirical parameters which are not known a priori. Traditional optimization-based parameter estimation frameworks may be ill-posed or computationally prohibitive. Bayesian inference methods have increasingly been found effective for estimating parameters in complex geophysical systems. These methods often are not viable in cases of computationally expensive models and high-dimensional parameter spaces. Recently, methods have been developed to effectively reduce the dimension of Bayesian inverse problems by identifying low-dimensional structures that are most informed by data. Active subspaces is one of the most generally applicable methods of performing this dimension reduction. In this paper, Bayesian inference of the parameters of a state-of-the-art mathematical model for methane hydrates based on experimental data from a triaxial compression test with gas hydrate-bearing sand is performed in an efficient way by utilizing active subspaces. Active subspaces are used to identify low-dimensional structure in the parameter space which is exploited by generating a cheap regression-based surrogate model and implementing a modified Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Posterior densities having means that match the experimental data are approximated in a computationally efficient way.},

 abstract = {Abstract In this article, we perform a parameter study for a recently developed karst hydrological model. The study consists of a high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problem and a global sensitivity analysis. For the first time in karst hydrology, we use the active subspace method to find directions in the parameter space that dominate the Bayesian update from the prior to the posterior distribution in order to effectively reduce the dimension of the problem and for computational efficiency. Additionally, the calculated active subspace can be exploited to construct sensitivity metrics on each of the individual parameters and be used to construct a natural model surrogate. The model consists of 21 parameters to reproduce the hydrological behavior of spring discharge in a karst aquifer located in the Kerschbaum spring recharge area at Waidhofen a.d. Ybbs in Austria. The experimental spatial and time series data for the inference process were collected by the water works in Waidhofen. We show that this case study has implicit low-dimensionality, and we run an adjusted Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm in a low-dimensional subspace to construct samples of the posterior distribution. The results are visualized and verified by plots of the posterior's push-forward distribution displaying the uncertainty in predicting discharge values due to the experimental noise in the data. Finally, a discussion provides hydrological interpretation of these results for the Kerschbaum area.},

 abstract = {Multi-fidelity modelling enables accurate inference of quantities of interest by synergistically combining
realizations of low-cost/low-fidelity models with a small set of high-fidelity observations. This isparticularly effective when the low- and high-fidelity
models exhibit strong correlations, and can lead to significant computational gains over approaches
that solely rely on high-fidelity models. However, in many cases of practical interest, low-fidelity models
can only be well correlated to their high-fidelity counterparts for a specific range of input parameters,
and potentially return wrong trends and erroneous predictions if probed outside of their validity regime.
Here we put forth a probabilistic framework based on Gaussian process regression and nonlinear
autoregressive schemes that is capable of learning complex nonlinear and space-dependent crosscorrelations
between models of variable fidelity, and can effectively safeguard against low-fidelity models
that provide wrong trends. This introduces a new class of multi-fidelity information fusion algorithms
that provide a fundamental extension to the existing linear autoregressive methodologies, while still
maintaining the same algorithmic complexity and overall computational cost. The performance of the
proposed methods is tested in several benchmark problems involving both synthetic and real multifidelity
datasets from computational fluid dynamics simulations.},

If we could just work together, I'll bet we would all get where we wanted to go a lot easier, faster, and without rear-ending each other"? As your frustration rises, you realize that impatient commuters aren't the most cooperative people. However, if you're a game player, uncooperative resource gatherers and infantry are probably even more frustrating than a real-life traffic jam. Figuring out how to get hundreds of units moving around a complex game map in real time - commonly referred to as pathfinding - is a tough task. While pathfinding is a hot industry buzzword, it's only half of the solution. Movement, the execution of a given path, is the other half of the solution. For real-time strategy games, this movement goes hand in hand with pathfinding. An axeman certainly needs a plan (as in, a path) for how he's going to get from one side of his town to the other to help stave off the enemy invasion. If he doesn't execute that plan using a good movement system, however, all may be lost. Game Developer has already visited the topic of pathfinding in such past articles as "Smart Move: Path-Finding" by Brian Stout (October/November 1996) and "Real-Time Pathfinding for Multiple Objects" by Swen Vincke (June 1997). Rather than go over the same material, I'll approach the problem from the other side by examining the ways to execute a path that's already been found. In this article, I'll cover the basic components of an effective movement system. In a companion article in next month's Game Developer, I'll extend these basic concepts to cover higher-order movement and implementation. Though the examples in these articles focus mainly on a real-time strategy game, the methods I'll describe can easily be applied to other genres.},

@article{prangle-2014-math,
 abstract = {Summary Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is an approach to sampling from an approximate posterior distribution in the presence of a computationally intractable likelihood function. A common implementation is based on simulating model, parameter and dataset triples from the prior, and then accepting as samples from the approximate posterior, those model and parameter pairs for which the corresponding dataset, or a summary of that dataset, is 'close' to the observed data. Closeness is typically determined though a distance measure and a kernel scale parameter. Appropriate choice of that parameter is important in producing a good quality approximation. This paper proposes diagnostic tools for the choice of the kernel scale parameter based on assessing the coverage property, which asserts that credible intervals have the correct coverage levels in appropriately designed simulation settings. We provide theoretical results on coverage for both model and parameter inference, and adapt these into diagnostics for the ABC context. We re-analyse a study on human demographic history to determine whether the adopted posterior approximation was appropriate. Code implementing the proposed methodology is freely available in the R package abctools.},

 comment = {In this thesis, we describe a new approach for detecting and tracking the behavior of dy- namical systems. The goal is to identify trends that deviate from normal behavior. A high-dimensional dataset, which describes the measured/observed parameters of a dynam- ical system, is embedded into a lower-dimension space by the application of the diffusion maps to it. Then, the sought after anomalies are detected in this lower-dimension em- bedded space. To achieve it, the diffusion maps methodology was extended to provide hierarchal (multi-scale) processing via the construction of super graphs. The frequency appearance of each point in the embedded space is quantitatively measures the system's state at each given time point. In addition, the data was reformulated to extract its hidden underlying oscillatory behavior which turns out to be a major source for failure of dynam- ical systems. Most of the presented algorithms have two sequential steps: training and detection. Graph alignment was developed to signal when the current computed training baseline data has to be updated. The classification of the status of each newly arrived data point as normal or abnormal depends on its location coordinates. These coordinates are determined by the application of a multi-scale Gaussian approximation procedure. In a second part of the thesis, we propose three novel algorithms for the detection of vehicles based on their recordings. The algorithms use different methods like wavelet packets and random projections to extract spatio-temporal characteristic features from the recordings. These form a unique acoustic signature for each of the recordings. The feature extraction procedure is followed by a dimensionality reduction step for reducing the size of the signature. The methods that are utilized are diffusion maps, classification trees and principal component analysis. A new recording can be classified by employing similar steps in the low dimensional structures, which were constructed on a training set, are extended to the newly collected acoustic recordings.},

This method suffers from two limitations. First, even though real-life data is often heterogeneous , the assumption in diffusion maps is that the attributes of the processed dataset are comparable. Second, application of the geometric harmonics requires careful setting for the correct extension scale and condition number. In this paper, we propose a method for representing and learning heterogeneous datasets by using diffusion maps for unifying and embedding heterogeneous dataset and by replacing the geometric harmonics with the Laplacian pyramid extension. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate how the learning process becomes straightforward when the constructed representation smoothly parameterizes the task-related function.},

if the model parameters are chosen correctly. The exact values of these parameters are often unknown, so the input suffers from uncertainties that can affect the output. To assure that the right conclusions are drawn from a simulation, modellers can employ forward uncertainty quantification methods.
However, applying such methods to the optimal steps model is rather uncommon. Therefore, this thesis addresses the question which approach is suitable for estimating the uncertainty and sensitivity of the model output. It focuses on polynomial chaos expansions, which allow to derive statistical moments and Sobol' sensitivity indices for uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, respectively. The polynomial chaos expansion combined with the point collocation method and the pseudo-spectral approach is applied to a corridor scenario and the results are compared to Monte Carlo simulations.
Thus, it can be shown that the point collocation method is efficient because it yields accurate results while the computational effort is low. Based on that, the method is transferred to a large scale scenario,a parade through a city center. The outcomes are interpreted to demonstrate that they are relevant to reality.},

 abstract = {Visual tracking, in essence, deals with non-stationary image streams that change over time. While most existing algorithms are able to track objects well in controlled environments, they usually fail in the presence of significant variation of the object's appearance or surrounding illumination. One reason for such failures is that many algorithms employ fixed appearance models of the target. Such models are trained using only appearance data available before tracking begins, which in practice limits the range of appearances that are modeled, and ignores the large volume of information (such as shape changes or specific lighting conditions) that becomes available during tracking. In this paper, we present a tracking method that incrementally learns a low-dimensional subspace representation, efficiently adapting online to changes in the appearance of the target. The model update, based on incremental algorithms for principal component analysis, includes two important features: a method for correctly updating the sample mean, and a forgetting factor to ensure less modeling power is expended fitting older observations. Both of these features contribute measurably to improving overall tracking performance. Numerous experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking algorithm in indoor and outdoor environments where the target objects undergo large changes in pose, scale, and illumination.},

 abstract = {Several systems discussed at this workshop on Spatio-Temporal Patterns in Non- equilibrium Complex Systems have been related to or analyzed in the context of the so-called Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGL). What is the difference between the physics underlying the usual amplitude description for stationary patterns and the one underlying the CGL? Why are there many more stable coherent structures [pulses, sources (holes), sinks] possible in systems described by the CGL than in systems exhibiting a stationary bifurcation, and what is their relation, if any, to the chaotic behavior that is characteristic of the CGL in some parameter regimes? The organizers of this workshop have asked me to try to provide some answers to these questions for the non-expert, someone with an interest in pattern formation but who has not had an introduction to the CGL before or who has not followed the recent developments in this field. Since there are several very recent review papers on this subject, where a more thorough and detailed discussion can be found, I will cofine myself here to a brief low-level introduction, in which I try to paint some of the main ideas with broad strokes. I stress that I do not pretend to give a balanced review | this chapter is extremely sketchy and coloured by my own interests, and I urge the reader interested in learning more about this line of research to consult the papers cited above and the references therein.},

 abstract = {We study a system of delay-differential equations modeling single-lane road traffic. The cars move in a closed circuit and the system s variables are each car s velocity and the distance to the car ahead. For low and high values of traffic density the system has a stable equilibrium solution, corresponding to the uniform flow. Gradually decreasing the density from high to intermediate values we observe a sequence of supercritical Hopf bifurcations forming multistable limit cycles, corresponding to flow regimes with periodically moving traffic jams. Using an asymptotic technique we find approximately small limit cycles born at Hopf bifurcations and numerically preform their global continuations with decreasing density. For sufficiently large delay the system passes to chaos following the Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse scenario (limit cycles-two-tori-three-tori-chaotic attractors). We find that chaotic and nonchaotic attractors coexist for the same parameter values and that chaotic attractors have a broad multifractal spectrum.},

 abstract = {Reinforcement learning is considered to be a strong AI paradigm which can be used to teach machines through interaction with the environment and learning from their mistakes. Despite its perceived utility, it has not yet been successfully applied in automotive applications. Motivated by the successful demonstrations of learning of Atari games and Go by Google DeepMind, we propose a framework for autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning. This is of particular relevance as it is difficult to pose autonomous driving as a supervised learning problem due to strong interactions with the environment including other vehicles, pedestrians and roadworks. As it is a relatively new area of research for autonomous driving, we provide a short overview of deep reinforcement learning and then describe our proposed framework. It incorporates Recurrent Neural Networks for information integration, enabling the car to handle partially observable scenarios. It also integrates the recent work on attention models to focus on relevant information, thereby reducing the computational complexity for deployment on embedded hardware. The framework was tested in an open source 3D car racing simulator called TORCS. Our simulation results demonstrate learning of autonomous maneuvering in a scenario of complex road curvatures and simple interaction of other vehicles.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems with symmetries exhibit a rich variety of behaviors, often described by complex attractor-basin portraits and
enhanced and suppressed bifurcations. Symmetry arguments provide a way to study these collective behaviors and to simplify their analysis.
The Koopman operator is an innite dimensional linear operator that fully captures a system's nonlinear dynamics through the linear evolution
of functions of the state space. Importantly, in contrast with local linearization, it preserves a system's global nonlinear features. We demonstrate
how the presence of symmetries affects the Koopman operator structure and its spectral properties. In fact, we show that symmetry
considerations can also simplify finding the Koopman operator approximations using the extended and kernel dynamic mode decomposition
methods (EDMD and kernel DMD). Specically, representation theory allows us to demonstrate that an isotypic component basis induces
a block diagonal structure in operator approximations, revealing hidden organization. Practically, if the symmetries are known, the EDMD
and kernel DMD methods can be modified to give more ecient computation of the Koopman operator approximation and its eigenvalues,
eigenfunctions, and eigenmodes. Rounding out the development, we discuss the effect of measurement noise.},

We discuss the Level E model with reference to two different settings. In the first setting, the objective is to find the input factor that drives most of the output variance. In the second setting, we strive to achieve a preestablished reduction in the variance of the model output by fixing the smallest number of factors. The emphasis of this work is on how to define the concept of importance in an unambiguous way and how to assess it in the simultaneous occurrence of correlated input factors and non-additive models.},

  abstract      = {Complex mathematical and computational models are used in all areas of society and technology and yet model based science is increasingly contested or refuted, especially when models are applied to controversial themes in domains such as health, the environment or the economy. More stringent standards of proofs are demanded from model-based numbers, especially when these numbers represent potential financial losses, threats to human health or the state of the environment. Quantitative sensitivity analysis is generally agreed to be one such standard. Mathematical models are good at mapping assumptions into inferences. A modeller makes assumptions about laws pertaining to the system, about its status and a plethora of other, often arcane, system variables and internal model settings. To what extent can we rely on the model-based inference when most of these assumptions are fraught with uncertainties? Global Sensitivity Analysis offers an accessible treatment of such problems via quantitative sensitivity analysis, beginning with the first principles and guiding the reader through the full range of recommended practices with a rich set of solved exercises. The text explains the motivation for sensitivity analysis, reviews the required statistical concepts, and provides a guide to potential applications. The book: Provides a self-contained treatment of the subject, allowing readers to learn and practice global sensitivity analysis without further materials. Presents ways to frame the analysis, interpret its results, and avoid potential pitfalls. Features numerous exercises and solved problems to help illustrate the applications. Is authored by leading sensitivity analysis practitioners, combining a range of disciplinary backgrounds. Postgraduate students and practitioners in a wide range of subjects, including statistics, mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, environmental sciences, biology, toxicology, actuarial sciences, and econometrics will find much of use here. This book will prove equally valuable to engineers working on risk analysis and to financial analysts concerned with pricing and hedging.},

 abstract = {Variance based methods have assessed themselves as versatile and effective among the various available techniques for sensitivity analysis of model output. Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y=f(X1,X2,....,Xk) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f(X1,X2,...,Xk) needed to complete the analysis, as f(X1,X2,....,Xk) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to use.},

  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis provides information on the relative importance of model input parameters and assumptions. It is distinct from uncertainty analysis, which addresses the question "How uncertain is the prediction?" Uncertainty analysis needs to map what a model does when selected input assumptions and parameters are left free to vary over their range of existence, and this is equally true of a sensitivity analysis. Despite this, many uncertainty and sensitivity analyses still explore the input space moving along one-dimensional corridors leaving space of the input factors mostly unexplored. Our extensive systematic literature review shows that many highly cited papers (42% in the present analysis) fail the elementary requirement to properly explore the space of the input factors. The results, while discipline-dependent, point to a worrying lack of standards and recognized good practices. We end by exploring possible reasons for this problem, and suggest some guidelines for proper use of the methods.},

For such time-dependent multi-scale problems, an "equation-free" framework has been proposed, of which patch dynamics is an essential component. Patch dynamics is designed to perform numerical simulations of an unavailable macroscopic equation on macroscopic time and length scales; it uses appropriately initialized simulations of the available microscopic model in a number of small boxes (patches), which cover only a fraction of the space-time domain. We show that it is possible to use arbitrary boundary conditions for these patches, provided that suitably large buffer regions "shield" the boundary artefacts from the interior of the patches. We analyze the accuracy of this scheme for a diffusion homogenization problem with periodic heterogeneity and illustrate the approach with a set of numerical examples, which include a non-linear reaction-diffusion equation and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.},

Using appropriately initialized fine-scale simulations, one can build a coarse time-stepper to approximate a time-stepper for the unavailable coarse model. Here, we use this coarse time-stepper to estimate matrix-vector products in a Jacobian-free Newton-GMRES method. The GMRES convergence is accelerated with a preconditioner that is derived from an approximate coarse equation.

  abstract  = {When engineering distributed software systems based on self-organizing emergent solutions, assessing and understanding the relation between the microscopic dynamics and the resulting macroscopic behavior is a fundamental issue. In our research, we investigate a systematic approach for understanding the link between microscopic and macroscopic behavior, based on a numerical analysis technique called equation-free macroscopic analysis. Instead of deriving a (simplified) macroscopic model, equation-free methods only assume that such a model exists, and mimic a macroscopic simulation using only appropriately initialized simulations with the complete system.There are two crucial issues in this technique. The first issue is defining a complete set of macroscopic variables that would uniquely characterize the self-organizing emergent behavior in the solution. The second issue is the definition of a suitable initialization operator, that can create a good initial condition for the complete system, given only the values of the macroscopic variables. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up approach for the selection of macroscopic variables and the related initialization operator. We show how the equation-free approach can guide simulations to systematically increase understanding of the studied system. To illustrate the approach, we use a data clustering system inspired by termite nest building algorithms.},

 abstract = {This thesis aims to investigate the advances in the field of reliability-sensitivity
analysis since the introduction of the Importance Factors by Hasofer (1974). In sensitivity analysis (SA), great efforts have been made to develop global and momentindependent sensitivity indices. However, previous work in global reliability-sensitivity
analysis (RSA) has not yet fully exploited or adopted the advantages of the global
moment-independent measures. To this end, this thesis introduces a new global
reliability-sensitivity index based on a modification of the \delta-index by Borgonovo
(2007). In addition, a new computational approach, denoted as Enhanced Adaptive
Kriging Monte Carlo Simulation (EAK-MCS), is developed to compute the indices at
the lowest possible costs. The new set of indices is tested and compared against other
established indices on four reliability benchmark problems. Eventually, the convergence of the new computational approach is compared against the ordinary Adaptive
Kriging Monte Carlo Simulation (AK-MCS) technique. It is concluded that the new
set of indices delivers numerically stable and equivalently ranked index values compared to the existing global indices. In combination with either the AK-MCS or the
EAK-MCS meta-modelling strategy, the indices may be computed with only a few
hundreds of full model evaluations.},

AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo'sown move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games.

@article{sirisup-2005-math,
 abstract = {We present a Galerkin-free, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-assisted computational methodology for numerical simulations of the long-term dynamics of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The approach is based on the "equation-free" framework: we use short, appropriate initialized bursts of full direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equations to observe, estimate, and accelerate, through "projective integration", the evolution of the flow dynamics. The main assumption is that the long-term dynamics of the flow lie on a low-dimensional, attracting, and invariant manifold, which can be parametrized, not necessarily spanned, by a few POD basis functions. We start with a discussion of the consistency and accuracy of the approach, and then illustrate it through numerical examples: two-dimensional periodic and quasi-periodic flows past a circular cylinder. We demonstrate that the approach can successfully resolve complex flow dynamics at a reduced computational cost and that it can capture the long-term asymptotic state of the flow in cases where traditional Galerkin-POD models fail. The approach trades the overhead involved in developing POD-Galerkin and POD-nonlinear Galerkin codes, for the repeated (yet short, and on demand) use of an existing full DNS simulator. Moreover, since in this approach the POD modes are used to observe rather than span the true system dynamics, the computation is much less sensitive than POD-Galerkin to values of the system parameters (e.g., the Reynolds number) and the particular simulation data ensemble used to obtain the POD basis functions.},

@book{strange-2014-math,
 abstract = {The last few years have seen a great increase in the amount of data available to scientists. Datasets with millions of objects and hundreds, if not thousands of measurements are now commonplace in many disciplines. However, many of the computational techniques used to analyse this data cannot cope with such large datasets. Therefore, strategies need to be employed as a pre-processing step to reduce the number of objects, or measurements, whilst retaining important information inherent to the data. Spectral dimensionality reduction is one such family of methods that has proven to be an indispensable tool in the data processing pipeline. In recent years the area has gained much attention thanks to the development of nonlinear spectral dimensionality reduction methods, often referred to as manifold learning algorithms.

Numerous algorithms and improvements have been proposed for the purpose of performing spectral dimensionality reduction, yet there is still no gold standard technique.

Those wishing to use spectral dimensionality reduction without prior knowledge of the field will immediately be confronted with questions that need answering: What parameter values to use? How many dimensions should the data be embedded into? How are new data points incorporated? What about large-scale data? For many, a search of the literature to find answers to these questions is impractical, as such, there is a need for a concise discussion into the problems themselves, how they affect spectral dimensionality reduction, and how these problems can be overcome.
This book provides a survey and reference aimed at advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as researchers, scientists, and engineers in a wide range of disciplines. Dimensionality reduction has proven useful in a wide range of problem domains and so this book will be applicable to anyone with a solid grounding in statistics and computer science seeking to apply spectral dimensionality to their work.},

  abstract = {Global sensitivity analysis (SA) aims at quantifying the respective effects of input random variables (or combinations thereof) onto the variance of the response of a physical or mathematical model. Among the abundant literature on sensitivity measures, the Sobol' indices have received much attention since they provide accurate information for most models. The paper introduces generalized polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) to build surrogate models that allow one to compute the Sobol' indices analytically as a post-processing of the PCE coefficients. Thus the computational cost of the sensitivity indices practically reduces to that of estimating the PCE coefficients. An original non intrusive regression-based approach is proposed, together with an experimental design of minimal size. Various application examples illustrate the approach, both from the field of global SA (i.e. well-known benchmark problems) and from the field of stochastic mechanics. The proposed method gives accurate results for various examples that involve up to eight input random variables, at a computational cost which is 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than the traditional Monte Carlo-based evaluation of the Sobol' indices.},

@article{sunnaker-2013-math,
 abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) constitutes a class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

@article{tu-2014-math,
 abstract = {Originally introduced in the fluid mechanics community, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of nonlinear systems. However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator. This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational efficiency and mitigate the effects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature, but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.},

 abstract = {This tutorial explains the foundation of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), an approach to Bayesian inference that does not require the specification of a likelihood function, and hence that can be used to estimate posterior distributions of parameters for simulation-based models. We discuss briefly the philosophy of Bayesian inference and then present several algorithms for ABC. We then apply these algorithms in a number of examples. For most of these examples, the posterior distributions are known, and so we can compare the estimated posteriors derived from ABC to the true posteriors and verify that the algorithms recover the true posteriors accurately. We also consider a popular simulation-based model of recognition memory (REM) for which the true posteriors are unknown. We conclude with a number of recommendations for applying ABC methods to solve real-world problems.},

@article{vandervaart-2018-math,
 abstract = {Abstract Stochastic computer simulations are often the only practical way of answering questions relating to ecological management. However, due to their complexity, such models are difficult to calibrate and evaluate. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) offers an increasingly popular approach to this problem, widely applied across a variety of fields. However, ensuring the accuracy of ABC's estimates has been difficult. Here, we obtain more accurate estimates by incorporating estimation of error into the ABC protocol. We show how this can be done where the data consist of repeated measures of the same quantity and errors may be assumed to be normally distributed and independent. We then derive the correct acceptance probabilities for a probabilistic ABC algorithm, and update the coverage test with which accuracy is assessed. We apply this method, which we call error-calibrated ABC, to a toy example and a realistic 14-parameter simulation model of earthworms that is used in environmental risk assessment. A comparison with exact methods and the diagnostic coverage test show that our approach improves estimation of parameter values and their credible intervals for both models.},

To carry out SC, one needs only a reliable deterministic simulation code that can be run repetitively at different parameter values. And yet, the modernday SC methods can retain the high-order accuracy properties enjoyed by most of other methods. This is accomplished by utilizing the large amount of literature in the classical approximation theory. Here we survey the major approaches in SC. In particular, we focus on a few well-established approaches: interpolation, regression, and pseudo projection. We present the basic formulations of these approaches and some of their major variations. Representative examples are also provided to illustrate their major properties.},

 abstract = {In [C.W. Gear, T.J. Kaper, I.G. Kevrekidis and A. Zagaris, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst. 4 (2005) 711-732], we developed a class of iterative algorithms within the context of equation-free methods to approximate low-dimensional, attracting, slow manifolds in systems of differential equations with multiple time scales. For user-specified values of a finite number of the observables, the mth member of the class of algorithms ($m = 0, 1, \ldots$) finds iteratively an approximation of the appropriate zero of the (m+1)st time derivative of the remaining variables and uses this root to approximate the location of the point on the slow manifold corresponding to these values of the observables. This article is the first of two articles in which the accuracy and convergence of the iterative algorithms are analyzed. Here, we work directly with fast-slow systems, in which there is an explicit small parameter, epsilon, measuring the separation of time scales. We show that, for each $m = 0, 1, \ldots$, the fixed point of the iterative algorithm approximates the slow manifold up to and including terms of $\{\mathcal O\}(\varepsilon^m)$. Moreover, for each m, we identify explicitly the conditions under which the mth iterative algorithm converges to this fixed point. Finally, we show that when the iteration is unstable (or converges slowly) it may be stabilized (or its convergence may be accelerated) by application of the Recursive Projection Method. Alternatively, the Newton-Krylov Generalized Minimal Residual Method may be used. In the subsequent article, we will consider the accuracy and convergence of the iterative algorithms for a broader class of systems - in which there need not be an explicit small parameter - to which the algorithms also apply.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

 abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 dif-ferent classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make train-ing faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implemen-tation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},

 abstract = {Three sampling methods are compared for efficiency on a number of test problems of various complexity for which analytic quadratures are available. The methods compared are Monte Carlo with pseudo-random numbers, Latin Hypercube Sampling, and Quasi Monte Carlo with sampling based on Sobol sequences. Generally results show superior performance of the Quasi Monte Carlo approach based on Sobol sequences in line with theoretical predictions. Latin Hypercube Sampling can be more efficient than both Monte Carlo method and Quasi Monte Carlo method but the latter inequality holds for a reduced set of function typology and at small number of sampled points. In conclusion Quasi Monte Carlo method would appear the safest bet when integrating functions of unknown typology.},

 abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the inferences that are drawn from physical models. It is this rather hazy separation between the descriptive and the explanatory aspects of science, between the functions of observational terms and of theoretical terms that has provided the material for much of the recent discussion in the philosophy of science. Three different levels of question can be asked about this, as about any other problem in philosophy of science. It is important to separate these levels, because the techniques used in answering them are significantly different. The aim is to begin from ordinary usage and when stipulation becomes necessary to choose those stipulations that will, so far as is possible, support those conceptual distinctions that are latent in actual scientific practice. A theory is something put forward to account for one or more empirical laws that are already known. It is not just a singular hypothesis but has some degree of generality. But it is something more than a mere higher-order generalization.},

@article{mnih-2015-math,
 abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account1, deeply rooted in psychological2 and neuroscientific3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems4,5, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms3. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains6,7,8, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks9,10,11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games12. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

  abstract    = {Different observations of a relation between inputs ("sources") and outputs ("targets") are often reported in terms of histograms (discretizations of the source and the target densities). Transporting these densities to each other provides insight regarding the underlying relation. In (forward) uncertainty quantification, one typically studies how the distribution of inputs to a system affects the distribution of the system responses. Here, we focus on the identification of the system (the transport map) itself, once the input and output distributions are determined, and suggest a modification of current practice by including data from what we call "an observation process". We hypothesize that there exists a smooth manifold underlying the relation; the sources and the targets are then partial observations (possibly projections) of this manifold. Knowledge of such a manifold implies knowledge of the relation, and thus of "the right" transport between source and target observations. When the source-target observations are not bijective (when the manifold is not the graph of a function over both observation spaces, either because folds over them give rise to density singularities, or because it marginalizes over several observables), recovery of the manifold is obscured. Using ideas from attractor reconstruction in dynamical systems, we demonstrate how additional information in the form of short histories of an observation process can help us recover the underlying manifold. The types of additional information employed and the relation to optimal transport based solely on density observations is illustrated and discussed, along with limitations in the recovery of the true underlying relation.},

@article{noe-2013-math,
 abstract = {The slow processes of metastable stochastic dynamical systems are difficult to access by direct numerical simulation due to the sampling problems. Here, we suggest an approach for modeling the slow parts of Markov processes by approximating the dominant eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the propagator. To this end, a variational principle is derived that is based on the maximization of a Rayleigh coefficient. It is shown that this Rayleigh coefficient can be estimated
from statistical observables that can be obtained from short distributed simulations starting from different parts of state space. The approach forms a basis for the development of adaptive and efficient computational algorithms for simulating and analyzing metastable Markov processes while avoiding the sampling problem. Since any stochastic process with finite memory can be transformed into a Markov process, the approach is applicable to a wide range of processes relevant for modeling complex real-world phenomena.},

stochastic process in probability theory. In the Fourties and Fifties,
pioneers as Kakutani and Doob did some research in the area of stochastical
analysis and recognized the importance of Brownian motion for the
Dirichlet problem.
This master thesis intends to give an explanation of the connection of
Brownian motion and the Dirichlet problem in a modern, mathematical and
closed context.
Although the results can be further generalized to Markov processes,
in case of Brownian motion and its useful properties, they stay clear and
understandable which effects the corresponding proofs.},

We model a directed graph as a finite set of observations from a diffusion on a manifold endowed with a vector field. This is the first generative model of its kind for directed graphs. We introduce a graph embedding algorithm that estimates all three features of this model: the low-dimensional embedding of the manifold, the data density and the vector field. In the process, we also obtain new theoretical results on the limits of "Laplacian type" matrices derived from directed graphs. The application of our method to both artificially constructed and real data highlights its strengths.},

This variation is such that when the procedure is applied to a quadratic form, it causes conjugate directions to be chosen, so the ultimate rate of convergence is fast when the method is used to minimize a general function. A further variation completes the method, and its ensures that the convergence rate from a bad approximation to a minimum is always efficient. Practical applications of the procedure have proved to be very satisfactory, and numerical examples are given in which functions of up to twenty variables are minimized.},

These systems are characterized by the distributions that are determined by the Hamiltonian and satisfy the Liouville equation. Few-particle systems of this class are described by a non-holonomic constraint: the power of non-potential forces is directly proportional to the velocity of the elementary phase volume change. The coefficient of this proportionality is determined by the Hamiltonian. In the general case, the examples of the few-particle systems of this class are the constant temperature systems, canonical-dissipative systems, and Fermi-Bose classical systems.},

 abstract = {Accelerated gradient methods play a central role in optimization, achieving optimal rates in many settings. While many generalizations and extensions of Nesterov's original acceleration method have been proposed, it is not yet clear what is the natural scope of the acceleration concept. In this paper, we study accelerated methods from a continuous-time perspective. We show that there is a Lagrangian functional that we call the \emph{Bregman Lagrangian} which generates a large class of accelerated methods in continuous time, including (but not limited to) accelerated gradient descent, its non-Euclidean extension, and accelerated higher-order gradient methods. We show that the continuous-time limit of all of these methods correspond to traveling the same curve in spacetime at different speeds. From this perspective, Nesterov's technique and many of its generalizations can be viewed as a systematic way to go from the continuous-time curves generated by the Bregman Lagrangian to a family of discrete-time accelerated algorithms.},

 abstract = {A data driven, kernel-based method for approximating the leading Koopman eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes in problems with high dimensional state spaces is presented. This approach approximates the Koopman operator using a set of scalar observables, which are functions defined on state space, that is determined {\em implicitly} by the choice of a kernel. This circumvents the computational issues that arise due to the number of basis functions required to span a "sufficiently rich" subspace of the space of scalar observables in these problems. We illustrate this method on the FitzHugh-Nagumo PDE, a prototypical example of a one-dimensional reaction diffusion system, and compare our results with related methods such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) that have the same computational cost as our approach. In this example, the resulting approximations of the leading Koopman eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes are both more accurate and less sensitive to the distribution of the data used in the computation than those produced by DMD.},

 abstract = {The asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with periodic boundary conditions is investigated for shuffled dynamics. In this type of update, in each discrete timestep the particles are updated in a random sequence. Such an update is important for several applications, e.g., for certain models of pedestrian flow in two dimensions. For the ASEP with shuffled dynamics and a related truncated process exact results are obtained for deterministic motion ( p = 1). Since the shuffled dynamics is intrinsically stochastic, also this case is nontrivial. For the case of stochastic motion (0 < p < 1) it is shown that, in contrast to all other updates studied previously, the ASEP with shuffled update does not have a product measure steady state. Approximative formulae for the steady-state distribution and fundamental diagram are derived that are in very good agreement with simulation data.},

 abstract = {Analog forecasting is a nonparametric technique introduced by Lorenz in 1969 which predicts the evolution of states of a dynamical system (or observables defined on the states) by following the evolution of the sample in a historical record of observations which most closely resembles the current initial data. Here, we introduce a suite of forecasting methods which improve traditional analog forecasting by combining ideas from kernel methods developed in harmonic analysis and machine learning and state-space reconstruction for dynamical systems. A key ingredient of our approach is to replace single-analog forecasting with weighted ensembles of analogs constructed using local similarity kernels. The kernels used here employ a number of dynamics-dependent features designed to improve forecast skill, including Takens' delay-coordinate maps (to recover information in the initial data lost through partial observations) and a directional dependence on the dynamical vector field generating the data. Mathematically, our approach is closely related to kernel methods for out-of-sample extension of functions, and we discuss alternative strategies based on the Nystr\"om method and the multiscale Laplacian pyramids technique. We illustrate these techniques in applications to forecasting in a low-order deterministic model for atmospheric dynamics with chaotic metastability, and interannual-scale forecasting in the North Pacific sector of a comprehensive climate model. We find that forecasts based on kernel-weighted ensembles have significantly higher skill than the conventional approach following a single analog.},

Its characteristic feature is that the positions of the pedestrians, modeled as hard-core particles, are updated in a fixed predefined order, determined by a phase attached to each of them. We investigate this model analytically and by Monte Carlo simulation on a one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions. At a critical value of the particle density a transition occurs from a phase with 'free flow' to one with 'jammed flow'. We are able to analytically predict the current-density diagram for the infinite system and to find the scaling function that describes the finite size rounding at the transition point.},

While the case of periodic boundary conditions was studied in a companion paper, we consider here open boundaries through which particles enter and exit at random times. The full phase diagram is predicted analytically and exhibits a transition between a free flow phase and a jammed phase. The density profile is predicted within the framework of a domain wall theory and compared to Monte Carlo simulations, in particular in the vicinity of the transition.

 abstract = {A lot of the data faced in science and engineering is not as complicated as it seems. There is the possibility of finding low dimensional descriptions of this usually high dimensional data. One of the ways of achieving this is with the use of diffusion maps. Diffusion maps represent the dataset by a weighted graph in which points correspond to vertices and edges are weighted. The spectral properties of the graph Laplacian are then used to map the high dimensional data into a lower dimensional representation. The algorithm is introduced on simple test examples for which the low dimensional description is known. Justification of the algorithm is given by showing its equivalence to a suitable minimisation problem and to random walks on graphs. The description of random walks in terms of partial differential equations is discussed. The heat equation for a probability density function is derived and used to further analyse the algorithm. Applications of diffusion maps are presented at the end of this dissertation. The First application is clustering of data (i.e. partitioning of a data set into subsets so that the data points in each subset have similar characteristics). An approach based on diffusion maps (spectral clustering) is compared to the K-means clustering algorithm. We then discuss techniques for colour image quantization (reduction of distinct colours in an image). Finally, the diffusion maps are used to discover low dimensional description of high dimensional sets of images.},

A translation-invariant version of the backward-ordered sequential update is defined for periodic boundary conditions. We prove that the so defined update leads to a stationary state in which all possible particle configurations have equal probabilities. Using the exact analytical expression for the propagator, we find the generating function for the conditional probabilities, average velocity and diffusion constant at all stages of evolution. An exact and explicit expression for the stationary velocity of \{TASEP\} on rings of arbitrary size and particle filling is derived. The evolution of small systems towards a steady state is clearly demonstrated. Considering the generating function as a partition function of a thermodynamic system, we study its zeros in planes of complex fugacities. At long enough times, the patterns of zeroes for rings with increasing size provide evidence for a transition of the associated two-dimensional lattice paths model into a clustered phase at low fugacities.},

The fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into independent information processing units which must interface with each other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is decomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which all interface directly to the world through perception and action, rather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions of central and peripheral systems evaporate---everything is both central and peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful series of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures in standard office environments.},

@article{budisic-2012-math,
 abstract = {A majority of methods from dynamical system analysis, especially those in applied settings, rely on Poincar\'{e}s geometric picture that focuses on "dynamics of states." While this picture has fueled our field for a century, it has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and uncertain systems, which are more and more common in engineered systems design and analysis of "big data" measurements. This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems, based on the "dynamics of observables" picture. The central object is the Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is nonetheless capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of this paper is to make it clear how methods that appeared in different papers and contexts all relate to each other through spectral properties of the Koopman operator. The second goal is to present these methods in a concise manner in an effort to make the framework accessible to researchers who would like to apply them, but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to provide a road map through the literature where each of the topics was described in detail. We describe three main concepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept, we provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them, numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when possible, applications that made use of them. The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic and theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its strengths in applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design.},

@article{chaturantabut-2010-math,
 abstract = {A dimension reduction method called discrete empirical interpolation is proposed and shown to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of the popular proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for constructing reduced-order models for time dependent and/or parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In the presence of a general nonlinearity, the standard POD-Galerkin technique reduces dimension in the sense that far fewer variables are present, but the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term remains that of the original problem. The original empirical interpolation method (EIM) is a modification of POD that reduces the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term of the reduced model to a cost proportional to the number of reduced variables obtained by POD. We propose a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a variant that is suitable for reducing the dimension of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a certain type. As presented here, it is applicable to ODEs arising from finite difference discretization of time dependent PDEs and/or parametrically dependent steady state problems. However, the approach extends to arbitrary systems of nonlinear ODEs with minor modification. Our contribution is a greatly simplified description of the EIM in a finite-dimensional setting that possesses an error bound on the quality of approximation. An application of DEIM to a finite difference discretization of the one-dimensional FitzHugh-Nagumo equations is shown to reduce the dimension from 1024 to order 5 variables with negligible error over a long-time integration that fully captures nonlinear limit cycle behavior. We also demonstrate applicability in higher spatial dimensions with similar state space dimension reduction and accuracy results.},

 abstract = {We describe a simple scheme, based on the Nystr?m method, for extending empirical functions f de?ned on a set X to a larger set X? . The extension process that we describe involves the construction of a specific family of functions that we term geometric harmonics. These functions constitute a generalization of the prolate spheroidal wave functions of Slepian in the sense that they are optimally concentrated on X. We study the case when X is a submanifold of Rn in greater detail. In this situation, any empirical function f on X can be characterized by its decomposition over the intrinsic Fourier modes, i.e., the eigenfunctions of the Laplace?Beltrami operator, and we show that this intrinsic frequency spectrum determines the largest domain of extension of f to the entire space Rn. Our analysis relates the complexity of the function on the training set to the scale of extension off this set. This approach allows us to present a novel multiscale extension scheme for empirical functions.},

We show that eigenfunctions of Markov matrices can be used to construct coordinates called diffusion maps that generate efficient representations of complex geometric structures. The associated family of diffusion distances, obtained by iterating the Markov matrix, defines multiscale geometries that prove to be useful in the context of data parametrization and dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework relates the spectral properties of Markov processes to their geometric counterparts and it unifies ideas arising in a variety of contexts such as machine learning, spectral graph theory and eigenmap methods.},

We discuss some very simple examples in the context of the "equation-free'' approach.

 abstract = {The evolution of a determining form for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), which is an ODE on a space of trajectories is completely described. It is proved that at every stage of its evolution, the solution is a convex combination of the initial trajectory and the fixed steady state, with a dynamical convexity parameter $\theta$, which will be called the characteristic determining parameter. That is, we show a remarkable separation of variables formula for the solution of the determining form. Moreover, for a given initial trajectory, the dynamics of the infinite-dimensional determining form are equivalent to those of the characteristic determining parameter $\theta$ which is governed by a one-dimensional ODE. for the parameter specifying the position on the line segment. This one-dimensional ODE is used to show that if the solution to the determining form converges to the fixed state it does so no faster than $\mathcal{O}(\tau^{-1/2})$, otherwise it converges to a projection of some other trajectory in the global attractor of the NSE, but no faster than $\mathcal{O}(\tau^{-1})$, as $\tau \to \infty$, where $\tau$ is the evolutionary variable in determining form. The one-dimensional ODE also exploited in computations which suggest that the one-sided convergence rate estimates are in fact achieved. The ODE is then modified to accelerate the convergence to an exponential rate. Remarkably, it is shown that the zeros of the scalar function that governs the dynamics of $\theta$, which are called characteristic determining values, identify in a unique fashion the trajectories in the global attractor of the 2D NSE. Furthermore, the one-dimensional characteristic determining form enables us to find unanticipated geometric features of the global attractor, a subject of future research.},

 abstract = {We develop a framework for dimension reduction, mode decomposition, and nonparametric forecasting of data generated by ergodic dynamical systems. This framework is based on a representation of the Koopman group of unitary operators in a smooth orthonormal basis of the L2 space of the dynamical system, acquired from time-ordered data through the diffusion maps algorithm. Using this representation, we compute Koopman eigenfunctions through a regularized advection-diffusion operator, and employ these eigenfunctions in dimension reduction maps with projectible dynamics and high smoothness for the given observation modality. In systems with pure point spectra, we construct a decomposition of the generator of the Koopman group into mutually commuting vector fields, which we reconstruct in data space through a representation of the pushforward map in the Koopman eigenfunction basis. We also use a special property of this basis, namely that the basis elements evolve as simple harmonic oscillators, to build nonparametric forecast models for arbitrary probability densities and observables. In systems with more complex spectral behavior, including mixing systems, we develop a method inspired from time change in dynamical systems to transform the generator to a new operator with improved spectral properties, and use that operator for vector field decomposition and nonparametric forecasting.},

  abstract = {Global  sensitivity  analysis  is  now  established  as  a  powerful  approach  for  determining  the  keyrandom input parameters that drive the uncertainty of model output predictions.  Yet the classicalcomputation  of  the  so-called  Sobol  indices  is  based  on  Monte  Carlo  simulation,  which  is  not  affordable when computationally expensive models are used, as it is the case in most applications in engineering and applied sciences.  In this respect metamodels such as polynomial chaos expansions(PCE) and Gaussian processes (GP) have received tremendous attention in the last few years, as they allow one to replace the original, taxing model by a surrogate which is built from an experimental design of limited size.  Then the surrogate can be used to compute the sensitivity indices in negligible time.  In this chapter an introduction to each technique is given, with an emphasis on their strengths and limitations in the context of global sensitivity analysis.  In particular, Sobol (resp.  total Sobol)indices can be computed analytically from the PCE coefficients.  In contrast, confidence intervals onsensitivity indices can be derived straightforwardly from the properties of GPs.  The performance ofthe two techniques is finally compared on three well-known analytical benchmarks (Ishigami, G-Soboland Morris functions) as well as on a realistic engineering application (deflection of a truss structure).},

This work proposes a method to construct an emulator for stochastic simulations by performing a designed experiment on the simulator and developing an emulative distribution. Existing emulators have focused on estimation of the mean of the simulation output, but this work presents an emulator for the distribution of the output. This construction provides both an explicit distribution and a fast sampling scheme. Beyond the emulator description, this work demonstrates the emulator???s efficiency, that is, its convergence rate is the asymptotically optimal among all possible emulators using the same sample size (under certain conditions). An example of its practical use is demonstrated using a stochastic simulation of fracture mechanics. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulation codes are very common tools to study complex phenomena, but they are often time-consuming and considered as black boxes. For some statistical studies (e.g. asset   management, sensitivity analysis) or optimization problems (e.g. tuning of a molecular model), a high number of runs of such codes is needed. Therefore it is more convenient to build a fast-running approximation - or metamodel - of this code based on a design of experiments. The topic of this paper is the definition of metamodels for stochastic codes. Contrary to deterministic codes, stochastic codes can give different results when they are called several times with the same input. In this paper, two approaches are proposed to build a metamodel of the probability density function of a stochastic code output. The first one is based on kernel regression and the second one consists in decomposing the output density on a basis of well-chosen probability density functions, with a metamodel linking the coefficients and the input parameters. For the second approach, two types of decomposition are proposed, but no metamodel has been designed for the coefficients yet. This is a topic of future research. These methods are applied to two analytical models and three industrial cases.},

abstract = {Metamodeling of complex numerical systems has recently attracted the interest of the mathematical programming community. Despite the progress in high performance computing, simulations remain costly, as a matter of fact, the assessment of the exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields is computationally prohibitive since one simulation can require hours. Moreover, in many engineering problems, carrying out deterministic numerical operations without considering uncertainties can lead to unreliable designs. In this paper we focus on the surrogate modeling of a particular type of computational models called stochastic simulators. In contrast to deterministic simulators which yield a unique output for each set of input parameters, stochastic simulators inherently contain some sources of randomness and the output at a given point is a probability density function. Characterizing the stochastic simulators is even more time consuming. This paper represents stochastic simulators as a stochastic process and describes a metamodeling approach based on the Karhunen-Lo??ve spectral decomposition.}

Replication plays an important role in that context, however previous methods leveraging replicates have either ignored the computational savings that come from such design, or have short-cut full likelihood-based inference to remain tractable. Starting with homoscedastic processes, we show how multiple applications of a well-known Woodbury identity facilitate inference for all parameters under the likelihood (without approximation), bypassing the typical full-data sized calculations. We then borrow a latent-variable idea from machine learning to address heteroscedasticity, adapting it to work within the same thrifty inferential framework, thereby simultaneously leveraging the computational and statistical efficiency of designs with replication. The result is an inferential scheme that can be characterized as single objective function, complete with closed form derivatives, for rapid library-based optimization. Illustrations are provided, including real-world simulation experiments from manufacturing and the management of epidemics.},

  abstract  = {Many practical problems, especially some connected with forecasting, require nonparametric estimation of conditional densities from mixed data. For example, given an explanatory data vector X for a prospective customer, with components that could include the customer's salary, occupation, age, sex, marital status, and address, a company might wish to estimate the density of the expenditure, Y, that could be made by that person, basing the inference on observations of (X, Y) for previous clients. Choosing appropriate smoothing parameters for this problem can be tricky, not in the least because plug-in rules take a particularly complex form in the case of mixed data. An obvious difficulty is that there exists no general formula for the optimal smoothing parameters. More insidiously, and more seriously, it can be difficult to determine which components of X are relevant to the problem of conditional inference. For example, if the jth component of X is independent of Y, then that component is irrelevant to estimating the density of Y given X, and ideally should be dropped before conducting inference. In this article we show that cross-validation overcomes these difficulties. It automatically determines which components are relevant and which are not, through assigning large smoothing parameters to the latter and consequently shrinking them toward the uniform distribution on the respective marginals. This effectively removes irrelevant components from contention, by suppressing their contribution to estimator variance; they already have very small bias, a consequence of their independence of Y. Cross-validation also yields important information about which components are relevant; the relevant components are precisely those that cross-validation has chosen to smooth in a traditional way, by assigning them smoothing parameters of conventional size. Indeed, cross-validation produces asymptotically optimal smoothing for relevant components, while eliminating irrelevant components by oversmoothing. In the problem of nonparametric estimation of a conditional density, cross-validation comes into its own as a method with no obvious peers.},

In this research, we focus on a multi-scale kernel based technique named Auto-adaptive Laplacian Pyramids (ALP). This method can be useful for function approximation and interpolation. ALP is an extension of the standard Laplacian Pyramids model that incorporates a modified Leave-One-Out Cross Validation procedure, which makes the method stable and automatic in terms of parameters selection without extra cost. This paper introduces a new algorithm that extends ALP to fit datasets that are non-uniformly distributed. In particular, the optimal stopping criterion will be point-dependent with respect to the local noise level and the sample rate. Experimental results over real datasets highlight the advantages of the proposed multi-scale technique for modeling and learning complex, high dimensional data.",

    abstract = "In time series predictor evaluation, we observe that with respect to the model selection procedure there is a gap between evaluation of traditional forecasting procedures, on the one hand, and evaluation of machine learning techniques on the other hand. In traditional forecasting, it is common practice to reserve a part from the end of each time series for testing, and to use the rest of the series for training. Thus it is not made full use of the data, but theoretical problems with respect to temporal evolutionary effects and dependencies within the data as well as practical problems regarding missing values are eliminated. On the other hand, when evaluating machine learning and other regression methods used for time series forecasting, often cross-validation is used for evaluation, paying little attention to the fact that those theoretical problems invalidate the fundamental assumptions of cross-validation. To close this gap and examine the consequences of different model selection procedures in practice, we have developed a rigorous and extensive empirical study. Six different model selection procedures, based on (i) cross-validation and (ii) evaluation using the series{\textquoteright} last part, are used to assess the performance of four machine learning and other regression techniques on synthetic and real-world time series. No practical consequences of the theoretical flaws were found during our study, but the use of crossvalidation techniques led to a more robust model selection. To make use of the {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}best of both worlds{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}, we suggest that the use of a blocked form of cross-validation for time series evaluation became the standard procedure, thus using all available information and circumventing the theoretical problems.",

The algorithms act on data coming from observables on a state space, arranged in Hankel-type matrices. The proofs utilize the assumption that the underlying dynamical system is ergodic. This includes the classical measure-preserving systems, as well as systems whose attractors support a physical measure. Our approach relies on the observation that vector projections in DMD can be used to approximate the function projections by the virtue of Birkhoff{\textquoteright}s ergodic theorem. Using this fact, we show that applying DMD to Hankel data matrices in the limit of infinite-time observations yields the true Koopman eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. We also show that the singular value decomposition, which is the central part of most DMD algorithms, converges to the proper orthogonal decomposition of observables. We use this result to obtain a representation of the dynamics of systems with continuous spectrum based on the lifting of the coordinates to the space of observables. The numerical application of these methods is demonstrated using well-known dynamical systems and examples from computational fluid dynamics.",

Each epoch is an application of the map induced by the optimization algorithm and the loss function. Using this induced map, we can apply observables on the weight space and measure their evolution. The evolution of the observables are given by the Koopman operator associated with the induced dynamical system. We use the spectrum and modes of the Koopman operator to realize the above objectives. Our methods can help to, a priori, determine the network depth; determine if we have a bad initialization of the network weights, allowing a restart before training too long; speeding up the training time. Additionally, our methods help enable noise rejection and improve robustness. We show how the Koopman spectrum can be used to determine the number of layers required for the architecture. Additionally, we show how we can elucidate the convergence versus non-convergence of the training process by monitoring the spectrum, in particular, how the existence of eigenvalues clustering around 1 determines when to terminate the learning process. We also show how using Koopman modes we can selectively prune the network to speed up the training procedure. Finally, we show that incorporating loss functions based on negative Sobolev norms can allow for the reconstruction of a multi-scale signal polluted by very large amounts of noise.",

The performance of the method is tested using experimental data obtained in the near field of a zero-net-mass-flux (ZNMF) jet. The better performance of HODMD is put in evidence making this technique suitable to both, cleaning the experimental noise using a limited number of snapshots and obtaining robust and sufficiently accurate results that elucidate the spatio-temporal structure of the flow. The results show that this ZNMF jet is temporally periodic in the near field, where the flow results from the interaction of a large number harmonics. These harmonics involve large scale spatial flow structures, identified as spatially growing instabilities, which are associated with the flow transition to turbulence in the far field.",

We propose an algorithm, based on local linear regression, to automatically detect coordinates corresponding to repeated eigendirections. We construct a more parsimonious embedding using only the eigenvectors corresponding to unique eigendirections, and we show that this reduced diffusion maps embedding induces a metric which is equivalent to the standard diffusion distance. We first demonstrate the utility and flexibility of our approach on synthetic data sets.

Here, we describe a method through which these eigenfunctions can be obtained from a kernel integral operator, which also annihilates the continuous spectrum. We show that incorporating a large number of delay coordinates in constructing the kernel of that operator results, in the limit of infinitely many delays, in the creation of a map into the point spectrum subspace of the Koopman operator. This enables efficient approximation of Koopman eigenfunctions in systems with pure point or mixed spectra.

It is shown that CkNN is geometrically consistent in the sense that under certain conditions, the unnormalized graph Laplacian converges to the Laplace-Beltrami operator, spectrally as well as pointwise. It is proved for compact (and conjectured for noncompact) manifolds that CkNN is the unique unweighted construction that yields a geometry consistent with the connected components of the underlying manifold in the limit of large data. Thus CkNN produces a single graph that captures all topological features simultaneously, in contrast to persistent homology, which represents each homology generator at a separate scale. As applications we derive a new fast clustering algorithm and a method to identify patterns in natural images topologically. Finally, we conjecture that CkNN is topologically consistent, meaning that the homology of the Vietoris-Rips complex (implied by the graph Laplacian) converges to the homology of the underlying manifold (implied by the Laplace-de Rham operators) in the limit of large data.",

Tuning the scale of the data-mining kernels can guide the construction of dynamic models at different levels of coarse-graining. In particular, we focus on the observability of physical space from temporal observation data and the transition from spatially resolved to lumped (orderparameter-based) representations, embedded in what we call an {\textquotedblleft}Equal Space{\textquotedblright}. Data-driven coordinates can be extracted in ways invariant to the nature of the measuring instrument. Such gauge-invariant data mining can then go beyond the fusion of heterogeneous observations of the same system, to the possible matching of apparently different systems. These techniques can enhance the scope and applicability of established tools in the analysis of dynamical systems, such as the Takens delay embedding. Our illustrative examples include chimera states (states of coexisting coherent and incoherent dynamics), and chaotic as well as quasiperiodic spatiotemporal dynamics, arising in partial differential equations and/or in heterogeneous networks.",

We prove that evaluating a local kernel on a data set gives a discrete representation of the generator of a continuous Markov process, which converges in the limit of large data. We explicitly connect the drift and diffusion coefficients of the process to the moments of the kernel. Moreover, when the kernel is symmetric, the generator is the Laplace{\textendash}Beltrami operator with respect to a geometry which is influenced by the embedding geometry and the properties of the kernel. In particular, this allows us to generate any Riemannian geometry by an appropriate choice of local kernel. In this way, we continue a program of Belkin, Niyogi, Coifman and others to reinterpret the current diverse collection of kernel-based data analysis methods and place them in a geometric framework. We show how to use this framework to design local kernels invariant to various features of data. These data-driven local kernels can be used to construct conformally invariant embeddings and reconstruct global diffeomorphisms.",

DMD relies only on the high-fidelity measurements, like experimental data and numerical simulations, so it is an equation-free algorithm. Its popularity is also due to the fact that it does not make any assumptions about the underlying system. See (Kutz et al. 2016) for a comprehensive overview of the algorithm and its connections to the Koopman-operator analysis, initiated in (Koopman 1931), along with examples in computational fluid dynamics. In the last years many variants arose, such as multiresolution DMD, compressed DMD, forward backward DMD, and higher order DMD among others, in order to deal with noisy data, big dataset, or spurius data for example. In the PyDMD package ({\textquotedblleft}PyDMD: Python Dynamic Mode Decomposition.

We show that this PCD Laplace (PointCloud Data Laplace) operator converges to the LaplaceBeltrami operator on the underlying manifold as the point cloud becomes denser. Unlike the previous work, we do not assume that the data samples are independent identically distributed from a probability distribution and do not require a global mesh. The resulting algorithm is easy to implement. We present experimental results indicating that even for point sets sampled from a uniform distribution, PCD Laplace converges faster than the weighted graph Laplacian.

The manifold assumption, which states that the data is sampled from a submanifold embedded in much higher dimensional Euclidean space, has been widely adopted by many researchers. In the last 15 years, a large number of manifold learning algorithms have been proposed. Many of them rely on the evaluation of the geometrical and topological of the data manifold. In this paper, we present a review of these methods on a novel geometric perspective. We categorize these methods by three main groups: Laplacian-based, Hessian-based, and parallel field-based methods. We show the connection and difference between these three groups on their continuous and discrete counterparts.

Rather than being available in the form of an explicit analytical model, often such systems can only be observed as a data set which embodies dynamics on several time scales. We focus on applying and adapting data-mining and manifold learning techniques to detect the slow components in a class of such multiscale data. Traditional data-mining methods are based on metrics (and thus, geometries) which are not informed of the multiscale nature of the underlying system dynamics; such methods cannot successfully recover the slow variables. Here, we present an approach which utilizes both the local geometry and the local noise dynamics within the data set through a metric which is both insensitive to the fast variables and more general than simple statistical averaging. Our analysis of the approach provides conditions for successfully recovering the underlying slow variables, as well as an empirical protocol guiding the selection of the method parameters. Interestingly, the recovered underlying variables are gauge invariant{\textemdash}they are insensitive to the measuring instrument/observation function.",

We apply this theory to obtain a decomposition of the process that utilizes spectral properties of the linear Koopman operator associated with the asymptotic dynamics on the attractor. This allows us to extract the almost periodic part of the evolving process. The remainder of the process has continuous spectrum. The second topic we discuss is that of model validation, where the original, possibly high-dimensional dynamics and the dynamics of the reduced model {\textendash} that can be deterministic or stochastic {\textendash} are compared in some norm.

They have an associated temporal frequency and growth rate and may be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of global eigenmodes of a linearized system. They provide an alternative to proper orthogonal decomposition, and in the case of periodic data the Koopman modes reduce to a discrete temporal Fourier transform. The Arnoldi method used for computations is identical to the dynamic mode decomposition recently proposed by Schmid \\\\& Sesterhenn ( Sixty-First Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics , 2008), so dynamic mode decomposition can be thought of as an algorithm for finding Koopman modes.

Koopman operator theory circumvents some of these issues by considering the dynamics in the space of observable functions on the state, in which the dynamics are intrinsically linear and thus amenable to standard techniques from numerical analysis and linear algebra. However, practical issues remain with this approach, as the space of observables is infinite dimensional and selecting a subspace of functions in which to accurately represent the system is a nontrivial task. In this work we consider time-delay observables to represent nonlinear dynamics in the Koopman operator framework. We prove the surprising result that Koopman operators for different systems admit universal (system-independent) representations in these coordinates, and give analytic expressions for these representations. In addition, we show that for certain systems a restricted class of these observables form an optimal finite-dimensional basis for representing the Koopman operator, and that the analytic representation of the Koopman operator in these coordinates coincides with results computed by the dynamic mode decomposition. We provide numerical examples to complement our results. In addition to being theoretically interesting, these results have implications for a number of linearization algorithms for dynamical systems.",

Rather than working with the underlying nonlinear model, we propose two simpler linear representations or model forms based on Koopman spectral properties. We show that these model forms are invariants of the generative model and can be readily identified directly from data using techniques for computing Koopman spectral properties without requiring the explicit knowledge of the generative model. We also introduce different notions of distances on the space of such model forms which is essential for model comparison/clustering. We employ the space of Koopman model forms equipped with distance in conjunction with classical machine learning techniques to develop a framework for automatic feature generation for time series classification. The forecasting/anomaly detection framework is based on using Koopman model forms along with classical linear systems and control approaches.

This research area tackles the important problem that complex machines and algorithms often cannot provide insights into their behavior and thought processes. XAI allows users and parts of the internal system to be more transparent, providing explanations of their decisions in some level of detail. These explanations are important to ensure algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to ensure that the algorithms perform as expected. However, explanations produced by these systems is neither standardized nor systematically assessed. In an effort to create best practices and identify open challenges, we describe foundational concepts of explainability and show how they can be used to classify existing literature. We discuss why current approaches to explanatory methods especially for deep neural networks are insufficient. Finally, based on our survey, we conclude with suggested future research directions for explanatory artificial intelligence.",

As shown here, even nonlinear finite-dimensional representations can be learned using the Koopman operator framework, leading to a new class of representation eigenproblems.

This paper synthesizes descriptions of kernel methods and Koopman operator theory in order to provide a single consistent account of KAF. The framework presented here illuminates the property of the KAF method that, under measure-preserving and ergodic dynamics, it consistently approximates the conditional expectation of observables that are acted upon by the Koopman operator of the dynamical system and are conditioned on the observed data at forecast initialization. More precisely, KAF yields optimal predictions, in the sense of minimal root mean square error with respect to the invariant measure, in the asymptotic limit of large data. The presented framework facilitates, moreover, the analysis of generalization error and quantification of uncertainty. Extensions of KAF to the construction of conditional variance and conditional probability functions, as well as to non-symmetric kernels, are also shown. Illustrations of various aspects of KAF are provided with applications to simple examples, namely a periodic flow on the circle and the chaotic Lorenz 63 system.",

Using classical, parameterbased techniques for modeling of modern systems, e.g., soft robotics or human-robot interaction, is often challenging or even infeasible due to the complexity of the system dynamics. In contrast, data-driven approaches need only a minimum of prior knowledge and scale with the complexity of the system. In particular, Gaussian process dynamical models (GPDMs) provide very promising results for the modeling of complex dynamics. However, the control properties of these GP models are just sparsely researched, which leads to a {\textquotedblright}blackbox{\textquotedblright} treatment in modeling and control scenarios. In addition, the sampling of GPDMs for prediction purpose respecting their non-parametric nature results in non-Markovian dynamics making the theoretical analysis challenging. In this article, we present the relation of the sampling procedure and non-Markovian dynamics for two types of GPDMs and analyze the control theoretical properties focusing on the transfer between common sampling approximations. The outcomes are illustrated with numerical examples and discussed with respect to the application in control settings.",

For the linear-quadratic case, we derive probabilistic performance guarantees using results from robust convex optimization.

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-t ime domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-b ased regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-d imensional problems.",

The key idea is to identify the linear (infinite dimensional) Koopman operator in the lifted space of observables, instead of identifying the nonlinear system in the state space, a process which results in a linear method for nonlinear systems identification. The proposed lifting technique is an indirect method that does not require to compute time derivatives and is therefore wellsuited to low-sampling rate data sets. Considering different finite-dimensional subspaces to approximate and identify the Koopman operator, we propose two numerical schemes: a main method and a dual method. The main method is a parametric identification technique that can accurately reconstruct the vector field of a broad class of systems. The dual method provides estimates of the vector field at the data points and is well-suited to identify high-dimensional systems with small datasets. This paper describes the two methods, provides theoretical convergence results, and illustrates the lifting techniques with several examples.",

Specifically, it investigates why a simple average of forecasts often outperforms forecasts from single models in terms of MSFEs, and why a more complicated weighting scheme does not always perform better than a simple average. In addition, this paper presents two new findings that are particularly relevant in practice. First, the MSFE of a forecast combination decreases as the number of models increases. Second, the conventional approach to the selection of optimal models, based on a simple comparison of MSFEs without further statistical testing, leads to a biased selection.",

In situations where a system is time varying, one would like to update the system{\textquoteright}s description online as time evolves. This work provides an efficient method for computing DMD in real time, updating the approximation of a system{\textquoteright}s dynamics as new data becomes available. The algorithm does not require storage of past data and computes the exact DMD matrix using rank-1 updates. A weighting factor that places less weight on older data can be incorporated in a straightforward manner, making the method particularly well suited to time-varying systems. A variant of the method may also be applied to online computation of {\textquotedblleft}windowed DMD,{\textquotedblright} in which only the most recent data are used. The efficiency of the method is compared against several existing DMD algorithms: for problems in which the state dimension is less than about 200, the proposed algorithm is the most efficient for real-time computation, and it can be orders of magnitude more efficient than the standard DMD algorithm. The method is demonstrated on several examples, including a time-varying linear system and a more complex example using data from a wind tunnel experiment. In particular, we show that the method is effective at capturing the dynamics of surface pressure measurements in the flow over a flat plate with an unsteady separation bubble.",

To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to utilize Koopman eigenfunctions as lifting functions for EDMD-based methods.

A one-level separation allows for background (low-rank) and foreground (sparse) separation of dynamical data, or robust principal component analysis. The multiresolution DMD (mrDMD) is capable of characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner by recursively decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose temporal coefficients in time are known. DMD modes with temporal frequencies near the origin (zero-modes) are interpreted as background (low-rank) portions of the given dynamics, and the terms with temporal frequencies bounded away from the origin are their sparse counterparts. The mrDMD method is demonstrated on several examples involving multiscale dynamical data, showing excellent decomposition results, including sifting the El Nin\\textasciitilde {}o mode from ocean temperature data. It is further applied to decompose a video data set into separate objects moving at different rates against a slowly varying background. These examples show that the decomposition is an effective dynamical systems tool for data-driven discovery.",

Motivated by the need of handling such data, we propose a novel spectral embedding algorithm, which we coined Robust and Scalable Embedding via Landmark Diffusion (ROSELAND). In short, we measure the affinity between two points via a set of landmarks, which is composed of a small number of points, and {\textquotedblleft}diffuse{\textquotedblright} on the dataset via the landmark set to achieve a spectral embedding. The embedding is not only scalable and robust, but also preserves the geometric properties under the manifold setup. The Roseland can be viewed as a generalization of the commonly applied spectral embedding algorithm, the diffusion map (DM), in the sense that it shares various properties of the DM. In addition to providing a theoretical justification of the Roseland under the manifold setup, including handling the U-statisticslike quantities, providing a L\${\i}nfty\$ spectral convergence with a rate, and offering a high dimensional noise analysis, we show various numerical simulations and compare the Roseland with other existing algorithms.",

Although single agents follow easily explainable rules, complex time-evolving patterns emerge due to their interaction. The simulation and analysis of such agent-based models, however, is often prohibitively time-consuming if the number of agents is large. In this paper, we show how Koopman operator theory can be used to derive reduced models of agentbased systems using only simulation data. Our goal is to learn coarse-grained models and to represent the reduced dynamics by ordinary or stochastic differential equations. The new variables are, for instance, aggregated state variables of the agent-based model, modeling the collective behavior of larger groups or the entire population. Using benchmark problems with known coarse-grained models, we demonstrate that the obtained reduced systems are in good agreement with the analytical results, provided that the numbers of agents is sufficiently large.",

At the second step, we construct reduced-order regression models on the manifold, in particular Multivariate Autoregressive (MVAR) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models, to forecast the embedded dynamics. At the final step, we lift the embedded time series back to the original high-dimensional space using Radial Basis Functions interpolation and Geometric Harmonics. For our illustrations, we test the forecasting performance of the proposed numerical scheme with four sets of time series: three synthetic stochastic ones resembling EEG signals produced from linear and nonlinear stochastic models with different model orders, and one real-world data set containing daily time series of 10 key foreign exchange rates (FOREX) spanning the time period 19/09/200129/10/2020. The forecasting performance of the proposed numerical scheme is assessed using the combinations of manifold learning, modelling and lifting approaches. We also provide a comparison with the Principal Component Analysis algorithm as well as with the naive random walk model and the MVAR and GPR models trained and implemented directly in the high-dimensional space.",

    abstract = "Computational models of the human head are promising tools for estimating the impact-induced strain response of brain, and thus play an important role in the study and prediction of traumatic brain injury. Modern biofidelic head model simulations are associated with very high computational cost, and highdimensional inputs and outputs, which limits the applicability of traditional uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods on these systems. In this study, a data-driven manifold learning-based surrogate modeling framework is proposed for UQ of computational head models. This framework is demonstrated on a specific model problem of a 2D subject-specific head model, where the goal is to quantify uncertainty in the simulated strain fields (i.e., output), given the variability in the material properties of different brain substructures (i.e., input). In the first stage of the proposed framework, a data-driven method based on multi-dimensional Gaussian kernel-density estimation and diffusion maps is used to generate realizations of the input random vector of material properties directly from the available data. Computational simulations of a small number of realizations provide input-output pairs for training data-driven surrogate models in the second stage. The surrogate models employ nonlinear dimensionality reduction using Grassmannian diffusion maps to identify a latent representation of the strain fields, Gaussian process regression to create a low-cost mapping between the input random vector and the reduced solution space, and geometric harmonics models for mapping between the reduced space and the Grassmann manifold. It is demonstrated that the surrogate models, even with small training dataset, lead to highly accurate approximations of the computational model while significantly reducing the computational cost. Monte Carlo simulations of the surrogate models are used for uncertainty propagation. UQ of strain fields highlight significant spatial variation in model uncertainty, and reveal key differences in uncertainty among commonly used strain-based brain injury predictor variables.",

Moreover, Koopman is intimately connected to dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), a method that discovers coherent, spatio-temporal modes from data, connects local-linear analysis to nonlinear operator theory, and importantly creates an equation-free architecture for the study of complex systems. For actuated systems, standard Koopman analysis and DMD are incapable of producing input-output models; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new theoretical developments extend Koopman operator theory to allow for systems with nonlinear input-output characteristics. We show how this generalization is rigorously connected to a recent development called dynamic mode decomposition with control. We demonstrate this new theory on nonlinear dynamical systems, including a standard susceptible-infectious-recovered model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).",

    abstract = "A spectral approach to building the exterior calculus in manifold learning problems is developed. The spectral approach is shown to converge to the true exterior calculus in the limit of large data. Simultaneously, the spectral approach decouples the memory requirements from the amount of data points and ambient space dimension. To achieve this, the exterior calculus is reformulated entirely in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator on functions. The exterior derivatives of these eigenfunctions (and their wedge products) are shown to form a frame (a type of spanning set) for appropriate L2 spaces of k-forms, as well as higher-order Sobolev spaces. Formulas are derived to express the Laplace-de Rham operators on forms in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplacian on functions. By representing the Laplace-de Rham operators in this frame, spectral convergence results are obtained via Galerkin approximation techniques. Numerical examples demonstrate accurate recovery of eigenvalues and eigenforms of the Laplace-de Rham operator on 1-forms. The correct Betti numbers are obtained from the kernel of this operator approximated from data sampled on several orientable and nonorientable manifolds, and the eigenforms are visualized via their corresponding vector fields. These vector fields form a natural orthonormal basis for the space of square-integrable vector fields, and are ordered by a Dirichlet energy functional which measures oscillatory behavior. The spectral framework also shows promising results on a non-smooth example (the Lorenz 63 attractor), suggesting that a spectral formulation of exterior calculus may be feasible in spaces with no differentiable structure. {\textcopyright} 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In this paper, we study a specific type of hierarchical function bases, defined by the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm{\textquoteright}s generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expertlevel performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.",

    abstract = "The current interest in big data, machine learning and data analytics has generated the widespread impression that such methods are capable of solving most problems without the need for conventional scientific methods of inquiry. Interest in these methods is intensifying, accelerated by the ease with which digitized data can be acquired in virtually all fields of endeavour, from science, healthcare and cybersecurity to economics, social sciences and the humanities. In multiscale modelling, machine learning appears to provide a shortcut to reveal correlations of arbitrary complexity between processes at the atomic, molecular, meso- and macroscales. Here, we point out the weaknesses of pure big data approaches with particular focus on biology and medicine, which fail to provide conceptual accounts for the processes to which they are applied. No matter their {\textquoteleft}depth{\textquoteright} and the sophistication of data-driven methods, such as artificial neural nets, in the end they merely fit curves to existing data. Not only do these methods invariably require far larger quantities of data than anticipated by big data aficionados in order to produce statistically reliable results, but they can also fail in circumstances beyond the range of the data used to train them because they are not designed to model the structural characteristics of the underlying system. We argue that it is vital to use theory as a guide to experimental design for maximal efficiency of data collection and to produce reliable predictive models and conceptual knowledge. Rather than continuing to fund, pursue and promote {\textquoteleft}blind{\textquoteright} big data projects with massive budgets, we call for more funding to be allocated to the elucidation of the multiscale and stochastic processes controlling the behaviour of complex systems, including those of life, medicine and healthcare.

Yet, despite this dynamical complexity, climate dynamics is known to exhibit coherent modes of variability. A primary example is the El Ni{\\textasciitilde n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the dominant mode of interannual (3{\textendash}5 yr) variability in the climate system. The objective and robust characterization of this and other important phenomena presents a long-standing challenge in Earth system science, the resolution of which would lead to improved scientific understanding and prediction of climate dynamics, as well as assessment of their impacts on human and natural systems. Here, we show that the spectral theory of dynamical systems, combined with techniques from data science, provides an effective means for extracting coherent modes of climate variability from high-dimensional model and observational data, requiring no frequency prefiltering, but recovering multiple timescales and their interactions. Lifecycle composites of ENSO are shown to improve upon results from conventional indices in terms of dynamical consistency and physical interpretability. In addition, the role of combination modes between ENSO and the annual cycle in ENSO diversity is elucidated.",

Besides, a newly developed Koopman-based frame- work, called Koopman with nonlinear forcing (KNF), leads to the same level of accuracy in the statistics at a significantly lower computational expense. Furthermore, the KNF framework outperforms the LSTM network when it comes to short-term predictions. We also observe that using a loss function based only on the instan- taneous predictions of the chaotic system can lead to suboptimal reproductions in terms of long-term statistics.
