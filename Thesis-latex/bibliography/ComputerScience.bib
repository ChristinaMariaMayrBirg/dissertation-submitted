@inproceedings{alumbaugh-2005-cs,
 abstract = {In this paper, we present simple and efficient array-based mesh data structures, including a compact representation of the half-edge data structure for surface meshes, and its generalization---a half-face data structure---for volume meshes. These array-based structures provide comprehensive and efficient support for querying incidence, adjacency, and boundary classification, but require substantially less memory than pointer-based mesh representations. In addition, they are easy to implement in traditional programming languages (such as in C or Fortran 90) and convenient to exchange across different software packages or different storage media. In a parallel setting, they also support partitioned meshes and hence are particularly appealing for large-scale scientific and engineering applications. We demonstrate the construction and usage of these data structures for various operations, and compare their space and time complexities with alternative structures.},

 abstract = {Advancing the state of the art of simulation in the social sciences requires appreciating the unique value of simulation as a third way of doing science, in contrast to both induction and deduction. This essay offers advice for doing simulation research, focusing on the programming of a simulation model, analyzing the results and sharing the results with others. Replicating other people's simulations gets special emphasis, with examples of the procedures and difficulties involved in the process of replication. Finally, suggestions are offered for building of a community of social scientists who do simulation.},

 abstract = {Traditional software engineering means have been characterized by a rather predictable process in the past. Users tell once and for all exactly what they want. Programmers design the system that will deliver those features. They code it; test it, and all is well. But all was not always well. The users did not tell once and for all exactly what they wanted. They changed their minds, and the users were not the only problem. Programmers could misjudge their progress. The academic software engineering community took the high cost of changing software as a challenge, creating technologies like relational databases, modular programming, and information hiding. This is where extreme programming comes in. Rather than planning, analyzing, and designing for the far-flung future, XP exploits the reduction in the cost of changing software to do all of these activities a little at a time, throughout software development. The paper discusses the major practices of XP.},

This class includes polyhedra, smooth and piecewise smooth surfaces, volumes enclosed by them, and above all non-manifolds. In contrast to previous approaches, the algorithm does not impose any restriction on the input angles. Although this algorithm has a provable guarantee about topology, certain steps are too expensive to make it practical.},

 abstract = {An efficient adaptive multigrid level set method for front propagation purposes in three dimensional medical image segmentation is presented. It is able to deal with non sharp segment boundaries. A flexible, interactive modulation of the front speed depending on various boundary and regularization criteria ensure this goal. Efficiency is due to a graded underlying mesh implicitly defined via error or feature indicators. A suitable saturation condition ensures an important regularity condition on the resulting adaptive grid. As a casy study the segmentation of glioma is considered. The clinician interactively selects a few parameters describing the speed function and a few seed points. The automatic process of front propagation then generates a family of segments corresponding to the evolution of the front in time, from which the clinician finally selects an appropriate segment covered by the gliom. Thus, the overall glioma segmentation turns into an efficient, nearly real time process with intuitive and usefully restricted user interaction.},

Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly. This article is a quick overview of Continuous Integration summarizing the technique and its current usage.},

@mastersthesis{hoy-2017-cs,
 abstract = {Pedestrian simulation models are becoming more frequently relied upon by researchers and practitioners when designing or evaluating transit stations, event venues, and other large facilities. However, the computational performance of these models can vary greatly and their relative accuracy is generally unexplored, leaving users with little guidance when selecting a model for their needs. Here, models based on the Social Forces, Optimal Steps, and static graph concepts are coded into MassMotion, then calibrated against observed pedestrian flow data using Genetic Algorithms. Using two transit station scenarios, each model's ability to match observed and increased volume pedestrian flows is explored and their relative speeds are compared, generally showing significant speed advantages over the default MassMotion model, but also indicating that the graph and Optimal Steps models are note sufficiently sensitive to congestion. Additionally, this work explores the behaviour of these models within various facility elements, including corridors, corners, and open spaces.},
 author = {Gregory Braeden Patchell Hoy},
 comment = {<note author="gk">
The author brutalizes the SFM and the OSM in equal manner and compares them to the pre-implemented SFM-type model in the commercial MassMotion tool and a very simple graph based method. He fails to see that the SFM is a set of ODEs that need to be solved numerically using a fine time step. Instead he uses Euler steps of size 0.5 sec. It is a miracle to me why  he does not observe - or report - overlaps. The OSM is "simplified" by dropping its two core characteristics: the natural step size per agent and the natural pace per agent, instead advancing agents each second by the step length they would need in that second to achieve their "current" speed (whatever that may be). The author observes throughput at two stations by counting: with very moderage traffic. All models perform similarily. Then the traffic at the station is increased. In the absence of real data the author declares MassMotion to be the ground truth. Based on that he concludes that only MassMotion and the related brutalized SFM match congestions..... and leaves me baffled.

 abstract = {Even bad code can function. But if code isnt clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesnt have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin, presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin, who has helped bring agile principles from a practitioners point of view to tens of thousands of programmers, has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code on the fly into a book that will instill within you the values of software craftsman, and make you a better programmerbut only if you work at it.What kind of work will you be doing? Youll be reading codelots of code. And you will be challenged to think about whats right about that code, and whats wrong with it. More importantly you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up codeof transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and smells gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.Readers will come away from this book understandingHow to tell the difference between good and bad codeHow to write good code and how to transform bad code into good codeHow to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classesHow to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logicHow to unit test and practice test-driven developmentWhat smells and heuristics can help you identify bad codeThis book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.},

 abstract = {Creating a mesh is the first step in a wide range of applications, including scientific
computing and computer graphics. An unstructured simplex mesh requires a choice of meshpoints
(vertex nodes) and a triangulation. We want to offer a short and simple MATLAB code, described in
more detail than usual, so the reader can experiment (and add to the code) knowing the underlying
principles. We find the node locations by solving for equilibrium in a truss structure (using piecewise
linear force-displacement relations) and we reset the topology by the Delaunay algorithm.
The geometry is described implicitly by its distance function. In addition to being much shorter
and simpler than other meshing techniques, our algorithm typically produces meshes of very high
quality. We discuss ways to improve the robustness and the performance, but our aim here is
simplicity. Readers can download (and edit) the codes from http://math.mit.edu/~persson/mesh.},

 abstract = {The fast marching algorithm computes an approximate solution to the eikonal equation in O(N log N) time, where the factor log N is due to the administration of a priority queue. 
Recently, Yatziv et al. (2006, J. Comput. Phys., 212, 393-399) have suggested using an untidy priority queue, reducing the overall complexity to O(N) at the price of a small error in the computed solution. 
In this paper we give an explicit estimate of the error introduced, which is based on a discrete comparison principle. This estimate implies, in particular, that the choice of an accuracy level that is independent of the speed function F results in the complexity bound being O(Fmax/Fmin N). A numerical experiment illustrates this robustness problem for large ratios Fmax/Fmin.},

 abstract = {The simulation of large crowds of autonomous agents with realistic behavior is still a challenge for several computer research communities. In order to handle large crowds, some scalable architectures have been proposed. Nevertheless, the effective use of distributed systems requires the use of partitioning methods that can properly distribute the workload generated by agents among the existing distributed resources. In this paper, we analyze the use of irregular shape regions (convex hulls) for solving the partitioning problem. We have compared a partitioning method based on convex hulls with two techniques that use rectangular regions. The performance evaluation results show that the convex hull method outperforms the rest of the considered methods in terms of both fitness function values and execution times, regardless of the movement pattern followed by the agents. These results show that the shape of the regions in the partition can improve the performance of the partitioning method, rather than the heuristic method used.},

 abstract = {There is a wide range of simulation software used to
investigate pedestrian dynamics. It is paramount for
researchers to know exactly what the models are performing
as this provides a better interpretation of the results. In
this paper we introduce JuPedSim, the J"\"{u}lich Pedestrian
Simulator. JuPedSim is an extensible framework for simulating
and analyzing pedestrians' motion at a microscopic
level. It consists at the moment of four modules which are
loosely coupled and can be used independently.The first
module simulates the movement of pedestrians given a
geometry and an initial configuration.The second module
visualizes the geometry and the trajectories. High
resolution videos can also be recorded directly from the
module interface. The third module analyses the results
from the simulation or any other source, for instance
experiments, and generates different type of plots such as
densities, velocities and flows. The last module is a
geometry editor to prepare the needed environment and input
files for the simulation and the analysis.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a method for robot motion planning in dynamic environments. It consists of selecting avoidance maneuvers to avoid static and moving obstacles in the velocity space, based on the cur rent positions and velocities of the robot and obstacles. It is a first- order method, since it does not integrate velocities to yield positions as functions of time. The avoidance maneuvers are generated by selecting robot ve locities outside of the velocity obstacles, which represent the set of robot velocities that would result in a collision with a given obstacle that moves at a given velocity, at some future time. To ensure that the avoidance maneuver is dynamically feasible, the set of avoidance velocities is intersected with the set of admissible velocities, defined by the robot's acceleration constraints. Computing new avoidance maneuvers at regular time intervals accounts for general obstacle trajectories. The trajectory from start to goal is computed by searching a tree of feasible avoidance maneuvers, computed at discrete time intervals. An exhaustive search of the tree yields near-optimal trajectories that either minimize distance or motion time. A heuristic search of the tree is applicable to on-line planning. The method is demonstrated for point and disk robots among static and moving obstacles, and for an automated vehicle in an intelligent vehicle highway system scenario.},

 abstract = {This tutorial is to introduce steering behaviours, a technique for giving moving objects in your game or simulation an amount of autonomy. Path finding through a 2D grid of different ground types is pretty much a solved problem, but to add more realism in games like Dungeon Keeper 2 and ThemePark World, we wanted to allow characters to be involved in crushes at doorways and for them not to walk through each other. After reading a paper written by Craig Reynolds called "Steering Behaviours for Autonomous Characters" we decided to implement and adapt the system to our own needs. Various other people have used the same techniques in their games, including Jim Van Verth and John O'Brien from Red Storm who extended the techniques for formation movement in their strategy tank game "Force 21". The behaviours themselves are simple to code but in combination can produce complex AI, and the resulting techniques can be used in both 2D and 3D with equal success. The discussion below first introduces the system, goes into detail of each behaviour, looks at strategies for combining the behaviours successfully to achieve a desired effect and finally covers some of the difficulties of using steering behaviours in a full production game.},

 abstract = {Abstract This paper describes the development of an ascending evacuation model based on physical work capacity of a selected sample. 
The model is based on the combination of several field experiments, existing databases and pre-tests that were combined to define initial test conditions in the 
laboratory environment on a step machine. Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) of 13 male and 12 female subjects (data was pooled), was measured, and they climbed at 
3 step rates specified according to individual percentage of their maximal aerobic capacity (%VO2max) levels. The first nineteen subjects were used for model development and the last six for validation. The paper gives an overview on the collected laboratory data and puts it into relation with the field data from both oxygen consumption 
and heart rate perspective. The maximum vertical displacement (hvert in m/min) can be calculated according to: hvert = - 21.7727 + 0.4024 * \{VO2max\} + 0.2658 * %VO2max. The discussion covers limitations and possibilities of the model and suggests the literature and databases that form the basis for practical use of the prediction model. Paper defines the needs for future work and possible information sources to improve the model.},

 abstract = {Introduction: We propose that active Bayesian inference - a general framework for decision-making - can equally be applied to interpersonal exchanges. Social cognition, however, entails special challenges. We address these challenges through a novel formulation of a formal model and demonstrate its psychological significance. Method: We review relevant literature, especially with regards to interpersonal representations, formulate a mathematical model and present a simulation study. The model accommodates normative models from utility theory and places them within the broader setting of Bayesian inference. Crucially, we endow people s prior beliefs, into which utilities are absorbed, with preferences of self and others. The simulation illustrates the model s dynamics and furnishes elementary predictions of the theory. Results: 1 Because beliefs about self and others inform both the desirability and plausibility of outcomes, in this framework interpersonal representations become beliefs that have to be actively inferred. This inference, akin to mentalizing in the psychological literature, is based upon the outcomes of interpersonal exchanges. 2 We show how some well-known social-psychological phenomena - e.g., self-serving biases - can be explained in terms of active interpersonal inference. 3 Mentalizing naturally entails Bayesian updating of how people value social outcomes. Crucially this includes inference about one s own qualities and preferences. Conclusion: We inaugurate a Bayes optimal framework for modeling intersubject variability in mentalizing during interpersonal exchanges. Here, interpersonal representations are endowed with explicit functional and affective properties. We suggest the active inference framework lends itself to the study of psychiatric conditions where mentalizing is distorted.},

Here we study the ASEP for different types of updates, namely random-sequential, sequential, sublattice-parallel, and parallel. In order to compare the effects of the different update procedures on the properties of the stationary state, we use large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and analytical methods, especially the so-called matrix-product Ansatz (MPA). We present in detail the exact solution for the model with sublattice-parallel and sequential updates using the MPA. For the case of parallel update, which is important for applications like traffic flow theory, we determine the phase diagram, the current, and density profiles based on Monte Carlo simulations. We furthermore suggest an MPA for that case and derive the corresponding matrix algebra.},

 abstract = {We present an approach for mobile robots to learn to navigate in dynamic environments with pedestrians via raw depth inputs, in a socially compliant manner. To achieve this, we adopt a generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) strategy, which improves upon a pre-trained behavior cloning policy. Our approach overcomes the disadvantages of previous methods, as they heavily depend on the full knowledge of the location and velocity information of nearby pedestrians, which not only requires specific sensors, but also the extraction of such state information from raw sensory input could consume much computation time. In this paper, our proposed GAIL-based model performs directly on raw depth inputs and plans in real-time. Experiments show that our GAIL-based approach greatly improves the safety and efficiency of the behavior of mobile robots from pure behavior cloning. The real-world deployment also shows that our method is capable of guiding autonomous vehicles to navigate in a socially compliant manner directly through raw depth inputs. In addition, we release a simulation plugin for modeling pedestrian behaviors based on the social force model.},

A mathematical analysis of the changing optic array at the driver's eye indicates that the simplest type of visual information, which would be sufficient for controlling braking and would also be likely to be easily picked up by the driver, is information about time-to-collision, rather than information about distance, speed, or acceleration/deceleration. It is shown how the driver could, in principle, use visual information about time-to-collision in registering when he is on a collision course, in judging when to start braking, and in controlling his ongoing braking. Implications of the theory for safe speeds and safe following distances are discussed, taking into account visual angular velocity detection thresholds, and some suggestions are made as to how safety on the roads might be improved.},

This has led to the development of numerous algorithms of varying degrees of complexity that aim to recover man ifold geometry using either local or global features of the data. Building on the Laplacian Eigenmap and Diffusionmaps framework, we propose a new paradigm that offers a guarantee, under reasonable assumptions, that any manifo ld learning algorithm will preserve the geometry of a data set. Our approach is based on augmenting the output of embedding algorithms with geometric informatio n embodied in the Riemannian metric of the manifold. We provide an algorithm for estimating the Riemannian metric from data and demonstrate possible application s of our approach in a variety of examples.},

The model uses reinforcement learning to guide groups of pedestrians towards a goal while adapting to environmental dynamics, and a cellular automaton to describe individual pedestrians' interactions. In contrast to traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning methods, our model encodes the learned navigation policy into a navigation map, which is used by the cellular automaton's update rule to calculate the next simulation step. As a result, reinforcement learning is independent of the number of agents, allowing the simulation of large crowds. Implementation of this model on the GPU allows interactive simulations of several hundreds of pedestrians.},

@article{scholl-2001-cs,
 abstract = {The notion that visual attention can operate over visual objects in addition to spatial locations has recently received much empirical support, but there has been relatively little empirical consideration of what can count as an 'object' in the first place. We have investigated this question in the context of the multiple object tracking paradigm, in which subjects must track a number of independently and unpredictably moving identical items in a field of identical distractors. What types of feature clusters can be tracked in this manner? In other words, what counts as an 'object' in this task? We investigated this question with a technique we call target merging: we alter tracking displays so that distinct target and distractor locations appear perceptually to be parts of the same object by merging pairs of items (one target with one distractor) in various ways -- for example, by connecting item locations with a simple line segment, by drawing the convex hull of the two items, and so forth. The data show that target merging makes the tracking task far more difficult to varying degrees depending on exactly how the items are merged. The effect is perceptually salient, involving in some conditions a total destruction of subjects' capacity to track multiple items. These studies provide strong evidence for the object-based nature of tracking, confirming that in some contexts attention must be allocated to objects rather than arbitrary collections of features. In addition, the results begin to reveal the types of spatially organized scene components that can be independently attended as a function of properties such as connectedness, part structure, and other types of perceptual grouping.},

 abstract = {This paper generalizes the concept of velocity obstacles given by Fiorini et al. (1998) to obstacles moving along arbitrary trajectories. We introduce the nonlinear velocity obstacle, which takes into account the shape, velocity and path curvature of the moving obstacle. The nonlinear v-obstacle allows selecting a single avoidance maneuver (if one exists) that avoids any number of obstacles moving on any known trajectories. For unknown trajectories, the nonlinear v-obstacles can be used to generate local avoidance maneuvers based on the current velocity and path curvature of the moving obstacle. This elevates the planning strategy to a second order method, compared to the first order avoidance using the linear v-obstacle, and zero order avoidance using only position information. Analytic expressions for the nonlinear v-obstacle are derived for general trajectories in the plane. The nonlinear v-obstacles are demonstrated in a complex traffic example.},

 abstract = {Distributed autonomous robotic units are dynamically assigned to manufacturing targets in a model of a complex manufacturing environment such that an objective function like the total profit is optimized. The introduced control of the robotic units is based an a self-organization approach motivated by the selection of modes in pattern formation of physical, chemical or biological systems. This approach is even resistant against sudden changes like breakdowns of some robotic units. In the present work, it is shown how environmental feedbacks like time delays from manoeuvring around obstacles can be considered such that, opposite to many other approaches, feasibility of the solutions can be guaranteed.},

The idea is perhaps a bit like the GNM but the directional vector represetns a decision, not a floor-field/potential.. The directional vector is a mollfied. The mollification is different from the MSFM, but as can be expected avoiding singularities is an idea that already occured in other contexts, not just the MSFM.},

@article{starke-2005-cs,
 abstract = {The assignment of distributed mobile autonomous robots to targets, which occurs for instance as an important task in flexible manufac- turing environments, is solved by using a self-organization approach motivated by pattern formation principles in biological, chemical, and physical systems. Similar to observations in many natural systems, such as ant tribes, the pattern formation of colored shells or convection patterns in the Rayleigh?B?nard problem of fluid dynamics, the self-organization principles lead to a robust and fault tolerant behavior where the patterns or structures recover from disturbances. The considered problem is the dynamic assignment of a number of robots to given targets where the mobile robots have to move to the targets in order to perform some tasks there. Hereby, each robot uses only local information (i.e., no world coordinate system is necessary). The underlying mathematical problem of the robot?target assignment is the so-called two-index assignment problem from combinatorial optimization. The approach used guarantees always feasible solutions in the assignment of robotic units to targets. As a consequence, for scenarios with only convex obstacles with large enough distances to each other, no spurious states cause the assignment process to fail. The error resistant control method for distributed autonomous robotic systems is demonstrated by several experiments with mobile robots. These results are compared and supplemented with computer simulations.},

However as any model is a simplification of the complex reality, the main purpose of any sustainability modelling (and the newly emerging area of sustainometrics) should be to allow dynamic representation, including the co-evolution of the sustainability systems and the role of humans as sustainability guardians.},

@article{treisman-1982-cs,
 abstract = {Examined the effects of perceptual grouping on search for targets defined by separate features or by conjunction of features. The author and G. Gelade (see record 1980-04685-001) proposed a feature-integration theory of attention, which claims that in the absence of prior knowledge, the separable features of objects are correctly combined only when focused attention is directed to each item in turn. If items are preattentively grouped, attention may be directed to groups rather than to single items whenever no recombination of features within a group could generate an illusory target. Four experiments, involving 46 high school or university students, confirmed these predictions. In search for conjunctions, Ss appeared to scan serially between groups rather than items. The scanning rate showed little effect of the spatial density of distractors, suggesting that it reflects serial fixations of attention rather than eye movements. Search for features appeared to be independent of perceptual grouping, suggesting that features are detected preattentively. A conjunction target could be camouflaged at the preattentive level by placing it at the boundary between 2 adjacent groups, each of which shared one of its features. This suggests that preattentive grouping creates separate feature maps within each separable dimension rather than one global configuration.},

 abstract = {TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.},

 abstract = {Model checking is emerging as a practical tool for detecting logical errors in early stages of system design. We investigate the model checking of sequential hierarchical (nested) systems, i.e., finite-state machines whose states themselves can be other machines. This nesting ability is common in various software design methodologies, and is available in several commercial modeling tools. The straightforward way to analyze a hierarchical machine is to flatten it (thus incurring an exponential blow up) and apply a model-checking tool on the resulting ordinary FSM. We show that this flattening can be avoided. We develop algorithms for verifying linear-time requirements whose complexity is polynomial in the size of the hierarchical machine. We also address the verification of branching time requirements and provide efficient algorithms and matching lower bounds.},

The text throughout refers to actual implemented robots and includes many pictures and descriptions of hardware, making it clear that these are not abstract simulations, but real machines capable of perception, cognition, and action.},

The algorithm protects edges with weighted points to avoid the difficulty posed by small angles between adjacent input elements. These weights are chosen to mimic the local feature size and to satisfy a Lipschitz-like property. A Delaunay refinement algorithm using the weighted Voronoi diagram is shown to terminate with the recovery of the topology of the input. Guaranteed bounds on the aspect ratios, normal variation, and dihedral angles are also provided. To this end, we present new concepts and results including a new definition of local feature size and a proof for a generalized topological ball property.},

Trying to detect an unknown number of unspecified errors by perusing tables of numbers is difficult and time--consuming with no guarantee of success. For simulation programs graphical techniques can be a useful means of detecting faults in coding and logic. The non-specific nature of visual monitoring makes use of the ability of the human brain to recognize spatial relationships and detect deviations from expected behaviour.},

@article{khatib-1986-cs,
 abstract = {This paper presents a unique real-time obstacle avoidance approach for manipulators and mobile robots based on the artificial potential field concept. Collision avoidance, tradi tionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, al lowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. This method has been extended to moving obstacles by using a time-varying artificial patential field. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm mechanisms and have used a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator con trol problem as direct control of manipulator motion in oper ational space--the space in which the task is originally described--rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kine matic transformation. Outside the obstacles' regions of influ ence, we caused the end effector to move in a straight line with an upper speed limit. The artificial potential field ap proach has been extended to collision avoidance for all ma nipulator links. In addition, a joint space artificial potential field is used to satisfy the manipulator internal joint con straints. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed by using visual sensing.},

At the same time, the field of machine learning has developed a large body of powerful learning algorithms for diverse applications. However, the true potential of these methods is not used, since existing implementations are not openly shared, resulting in software with low usability, and weak interoperability. We argue that this situation can be significantly improved by increasing incentives for researchers to publish their software under an open source model. Additionally, we outline the problems authors are faced with when trying to publish algorithmic implementations of machine learning methods. We believe that a resource of peer reviewed software accompanied by short articles would be highly valuable to both the machine learning and the general scientific community.},

    abstract = {Introduction Academic computer science has an odd relationship with software: Publishing papers about software is considered a distinctly stronger contribution than publishing the software. The historical reasons for this paradox no longer apply, but their legacy remains. This limits researchers who see the open-source software movement as an opportunity to make a scholarly contribution. Expanded definitions of scholarship acknowledge both application and discovery as important components. 1 One obstacle remains: evaluation. To raise software to the status of a first-class contribution, we propose "best practices" for the evaluation of the scholarly contribution of open-source software. Typically, scholars who develop software do not include it as a primary contribution for performance reviews. Instead, they write articles about the software and present the articles as contributions. This conflation of articles and software serves neither medium well. An article describes an original intellectual contribution consisting of an idea, the argument for its importance and correctness, and supporting data. In contrast, software is more often an implementation of prior ideas in a usable form. It bridges the often considerable gap between an idea and the practical application of that idea. The original idea and its implementation represent distinct kinds of contribution. The critical gap is the perceived incomparability of these two contributions. Lacking a concise description adapted to the traditional practices of performance review committees, software is difficult to evaluate as a scholarly contribution and is often relegated to second-class status. We propose a framework for common assessment based on widely accepted definitions of scholarship. Within this general framework, we consider the material and procedures that a performance review committee uses to evaluate a publication. We then describe how software can be summarized in a compatible form of bibliographic citation and supplementary material.},

    abstract = {Research software has become a central asset in academic research. It optimizes existing and enables new research methods, implements and embeds research knowledge, and constitutes an essential research product in itself. Research software must be sustainable in order to understand, replicate, reproduce, and build upon existing research or conduct new research e ectively. In other words, software must be available, discoverable, usable, and adaptable to new needs, both now and in the future. Research software therefore requires an environment that supports sustainability. Hence, a change is needed in the way research software development and maintenance are currently motivated, incentivized, funded, structurally and infrastructurally supported, and legally treated. Failing to do so will threaten the quality and validity of research. In this paper, we identify challenges for research software sustainability in Germany and beyond, in terms of motivation, selection, research software engineering personnel, funding, infrastructure, and legal aspects. Besides researchers, we speci cally address political and academic decision-makers to increase awareness of the importance and needs of sustainable research software practices. In particular, we recommend strategies and measures to create an environment for sustainable research software, with the ultimate goal to ensure that software-driven research is valid, reproducible and sustainable, and that software is recognized as a rst class citizen in research. This paper is the outcome of two workshops run in Germany in 2019, at deRSE19 - the rst International Conference of Research Software Engineers in Germany - and a dedicated DFG-supported follow-up workshop in Berlin.},

    abstract = {Abstract Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves 1 and in the first imaging of a black hole 2 . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

    abstract = {Despite advances in scalable models, the inference tools used for Gaussian processes (GPs) have yet to fully capitalize on developments in computing hardware. We present an efficient and general approach to GP inference based on Blackbox Matrix-Matrix multiplication (BBMM). BBMM inference uses a modified batched version of the conjugate gradients algorithm to derive all terms for training and inference in a single call. BBMM reduces the asymptotic complexity of exact GP inference from O(n3) to O(n2). Adapting this algorithm to scalable approximations and complex GP models simply requires a routine for efficient matrix-matrix multiplication with the kernel and its derivative. In addition, BBMM uses a specialized preconditioner to substantially speed up convergence. In experiments we show that BBMM effectively uses GPU hardware to dramatically accelerate both exact GP inference and scalable approximations. Additionally, we provide GPyTorch, a software platform for scalable GP inference via BBMM, built on PyTorch.},

However, the most computationally expensive part of many computer vision and machine learning algorithms consists of finding nearest neighbor matches to high dimensional vectors that represent the training data. We propose new algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor matching and evaluate and compare them with previous algorithms. For matching high dimensional features, we find two algorithms to be the most efficient: the randomized k-d forest and a new algorithm proposed in this paper, the priority search k-means tree. We also propose a new algorithm for matching binary features by searching multiple hierarchical clustering trees and show it outperforms methods typically used in the literature. We show that the optimal nearest neighbor algorithm and its parameters depend on the data set characteristics and describe an automated configuration procedure for finding the best algorithm to search a particular data set. In order to scale to very large data sets that would otherwise not fit in the memory of a single machine, we propose a distributed nearest neighbor matching framework that can be used with any of the algorithms described in the paper. All this research has been released as an open source library called fast library for approximate nearest neighbors (FLANN), which has been incorporated into OpenCV and is now one of the most popular libraries for nearest neighbor matching.},

However, few researches have investigated the dominant projects in a software ecosystem. In this study, we aim to identify the most influential projects in the GitHub Python ecosystem. We first construct the GitHub Python ecosystem with 19797 projects by identifying their interdependencies. Then, we calculate the four kinds of centrality metrics to measure the centrality and influence of each project in the ecosystem. Finally, we evaluate the project{\textquoteright}s popularity using GitHub social methods and compare the consistency of the two measurements. Our results indicate that 1) the most influential projects are mostly custom libraries; 2) only a small number of projects have large values of the centrality metrics; 3) the dominant projects are not always popular among the GitHub users. Our results help the researchers and practitioners gain a better understanding of the GitHub Python ecosystem.},

While it is quite important to keep the services provided by these machine learning systems stable, maintaining stability can be difficult given the nature of machine learning systems whose behaviors can be determined by program codes and input data. Therefore, quick troubleshooting (problem localization, rollback, etc.) is necessary. However, common machine learning systems with three-layer architectural patterns complicate the troubleshooting process because of their tightly coupled functions (e.g., business logic coded from design and inference engine derived from data). To solve the problem, we propose a novel architectural pattern for machine learning systems in which components for business logic and components for machine learning are separated. This architectural pattern helps operators break down the failures into a business logic part and a ML-specific part, and they can rollback the inference engine independent of the business logic when the inference engine has some problems. Through a practical case study scenario, we will show how our architectural pattern can make troubleshooting easier than common three-layer architecture.},

    abstract = {In the past several years, the field of machine learning has seen an explosion of interest and excitement, with hundreds or thousands of algorithms developed for different tasks every year. But a primary problem faced by the field is the ability to scale to larger and larger data{\textemdash}since it is known that training on larger datasets typically produces better results (Halevy, Norvig, and Pereira 2009). Therefore, the development of new algorithms for the continued growth of the field depends largely on the existence of good tooling and libraries that enable researchers and practitioners to quickly prototype and develop solutions (Sonnenburg et al. 2007). Simultaneously, useful libraries must also be efficient and well-implemented. This has motivated our development of mlpack.},

Unfortunately, developing dual-tree algorithms for use with different trees and problems is often complex and burdensome. We introduce a four-part logical split: the tree, the traversal, the point-to-point base case, and the pruning rule. We provide a meta-algorithm which allows development of dual-tree algorithms in a tree-independent manner and easy extension to entirely new types of trees. Representations are provided for five common algorithms; for k-nearest neighbor search, this leads to a novel, tighter pruning bound. The meta-algorithm also allows straightforward extensions to massively parallel settings.},

If the point set has a bounded expansion constant c, which is a measure of the intrinsic dimensionality, as defined in (Karger \\\& Ruhl, 2002), the cover tree data structure can be constructed in O (c6n log n) time. Furthermore, nearest neighbor queries require time only logarithmic in n, in particular O (c12 log n) time. Our experimental results show speedups over the brute force search varying between one and several orders of magnitude on natural machine learning datasets.},

In the physical sciences, structures such as metastable and coherent sets, slow relaxation processes, collective variables, dominant transition pathways or manifolds and channels of probability flow can be of great importance for understanding and characterizing the kinetic, thermodynamic and mechanistic properties of the system. Deeptime is a general purpose Python library offering various tools to estimate dynamical models based on time-series data including conventional linear learning methods, such as Markov state models (MSMs), Hidden Markov Models and Koopman models, as well as kernel and deep learning approaches such as VAMPnets and deep MSMs. The library is largely compatible with scikit-learn, having a range of Estimator classes for these different models, but in contrast to scikit-learn also provides deep Model classes, e.g. in the case of an MSM, which provide a multitude of analysis methods to compute interesting thermodynamic, kinetic and dynamical quantities, such as free energies, relaxation times and transition paths. The library is designed for ease of use but also easily maintainable and extensible code. In this paper we introduce the main features and structure of the deeptime software.},

The software serves as both a user-ready toolbox that includes many of the latest methods for UQ in computational modeling and a convenient development envi- ronment for Python programmers advancing the field of UQ. The paper presents an introduction to the software{\textquoteright}s architecture and existing capabilities, divided in the code in a set of modules centered around different UQ tasks such as sampling methods, generation of random processes and random fields, probabilistic inverse modeling, reliability analysis, surrogate modeling, and active learning. The paper also highlights the importance of the RunModel module, which is used to drive simulations in the uncertainty analyses performed in UQpy. This module conveniently allows the user to define computational models directly in Python, or to run simulations from a third-party software in serial or in parallel. To illustrate the various capabilities, two examples are tracked throughout the paper and analyzed repeatedly for various UQ tasks. The first is a Python model solving a nonlinear structural dynamics problem, used to illustrate UQpy{\textquoteright}s capabilities in sampling and forward propa- gation of high dimensional random vectors (stochastic processes), and probabilistic inference. The second model is a third-party Abaqus finite element model solving the thermomechanical response of a beam structure. This example is used to illustrate UQpy{\textquoteright}s capabilities in variance reduction sampling techniques, reliability analysis, surrogate modeling and active learning techniques.},

JOSS is a free and open-access journal that publishes articles describing research software. It has the dual goals of improving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for research software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within the current merit system of science, JOSS addresses the dearth of rewards for key contributions to science made in the form of software. JOSS publishes articles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its rigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality, documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A JOSS article contains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, references, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point of a JOSS submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts. Submission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub. Editors, reviewers, and authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, JOSS does not reject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, JOSS gives it a DOI, deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services. Authors retain copyright of their JOSS article, releasing it under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. In its first year, starting in May 2016, JOSS published 111 articles, with more than 40 additional articles under review.

	abstract 	= {There is a growing interest in model-based decision support under deep uncertainty, reflected in a variety of approaches being put forward in the literature. A key idea shared among these is the use of models for exploratory rather than predictive purposes. Exploratory modeling aims at exploring the implications for decision making of the various presently irresolvable uncertainties. This is achieved by conducting series of computational experiments that cover how the various uncertainties might resolve. This paper presents an open source library supporting this. The Exploratory Modeling Workbench is implemented in Python. It is designed to (i) support the generation and execution of series of computational experiments; and (ii) support the visualization and analysis of the results from the computational experiments. The Exploratory Modeling Workbench enables users to easily perform exploratory modeling with existing models, identify the policy-relevant uncertainties, assess the efficacy of policy options, and iteratively improve candidate strategies.},

abstract = {Model composition is combining separate models into an integrated composite model. Composability is the capability to select and compose models in various combinations into simulation systems to satisfy specific user requirements. Composability has been an important research objective for some time, especially in the defense-related modeling and simulation community, but general composability remains a challenging goal. Model reuse is reusing an existing model for a new application. Reuse can reduce the time, effort, and expense of model development and testing. Because the models to be reused are usually implemented as software components, general software reuse techniques are often applicable. In addition, frameworks and standards specific to modeling and simulation have developed to support model composition and reuse. Model composition and reuse are closely related. Composability is an important enabler for reuse, and reusing a software implementation of a model may require that it be composable.},

abstract = {The particulate nature of granular soils can be accurately simulated at a microscale level. However, due to the huge spatial extent of geotechnical systems, a model fully constructed at such a scale is almost impossible with current computing technologies. Hence, continuum-based approaches are considered as the practical scale for modeling the majority of problems. Combining both scales enables benefiting from the advantages of both techniques while trying to overcome their drawbacks. Although a significant number of publications have addressed coupling both scales, only a few provide information regarding implementing the proposed procedures. In this study, an efficient co-simulation framework for conducting multiscale analysis is introduced. The framework is based on integrating existing continuum and micromechanical modeling software packages and therefore benefitting from already existing codes. A computational simulation of a rigid pile in contact with granular soil demonstrating the capabilities of such technique is presented. The near-field zone surrounding the pile is modeled using DEM whereas FEM is utilized to model far-field zones that are not affected by the presence of the pile. Results of conducted simulations resemble those obtained from experimental results. The proposed approach appears to be a very effective and promising tool to model boundary value problems of geotechnical systems.},

abstract = {Co-simulation is a promising approach for the modelling and simulation of complex systems, that makes use of mature simulation tools in the respective domains. It has been applied in various different domains, oftentimes without a comprehensive study of the impact to the simulation results. As a consequence, over the recent years, researchers have set out to understand the essential challenges arising from the application of this technique. This paper complements the existing surveys in that the social and empirical aspects were addressed. More than 50 experts participated in a two-stage Delphi study to determine current challenges, research needs and promising standards and tools. Furthermore, an analysis of the strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats of co-simulation utilizing the analytic hierarchy process resulting in a SWOT-AHP analysis is presented. The empirical results of this study show that experts consider the FMI standard to be the most promising standard for continuous time, discrete event and hybrid co-simulation. The results of the SWOT-AHP analysis indicate that factors related to strengths and opportunities predominate.},

  abstract  = {Research software is a critical component of contemporary scholarship. Yet, most research software is developed and managed in ways that are at odds with its long-term sustainability. This paper presents findings from a survey of 1149 researchers, primarily from the United States, about sustainability challenges they face in developing and using research software. Some of our key findings include a repeated need for more opportunities and time for developers of research software to receive training. These training needs cross the software lifecycle and various types of tools. We also identified the recurring need for better models of funding research software and for providing credit to those who develop the software so they can advance in their careers. The results of this survey will help inform future infrastructure and service support for software developers and users, as well as national research policy aimed at increasing the sustainability of research software.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been successfully applied in various neurodegenerative diseases as an effective symptomatic treatment. However, its mechanisms of action within the brain network are still poorly understood. Many virtual DBS models analyze a subnetwork around the basal ganglia and its dynamics as a spiking network with their details validated by experimental data. However, connectomic evidence shows widespread effects of DBS affecting many different cortical and subcortical areas. From a clinical perspective, various effects of DBS besides the motoric impact have been demonstrated. The neuroinformatics platform The Virtual Brain (TVB) offers a modeling framework allowing us to virtually perform stimulation, including DBS, and forecast the outcome from a dynamic systems perspective prior to invasive surgery with DBS lead placement. For an accurate prediction of the effects of DBS, we implement a detailed spiking model of the basal ganglia, which we combine with TVB via our previously developed co-simulation environment. This multiscale co-simulation approach builds on the extensive previous literature of spiking models of the basal ganglia while simultaneously offering a whole-brain perspective on widespread effects of the stimulation going beyond the motor circuit. In the first demonstration of our model, we show that virtual DBS can move the firing rates of a Parkinson's disease patient's thalamus - basal ganglia network towards the healthy regime while, at the same time, altering the activity in distributed cortical regions with a pronounced effect in frontal regions. Thus, we provide proof of concept for virtual DBS in a co-simulation environment with TVB. The developed modeling approach has the potential to optimize DBS lead placement and configuration and forecast the success of DBS treatment for individual patients.},

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used successfully as symptomatic treatment in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson???s disease (PD). However, the mechanisms of its activity inside the brain network are unclear. Many virtual DBS models investigate the dynamics of a subnetwork surrounding the basal ganglia (BG) as a spiking network has been attracting a growing body of research in neuroscience. Connectomic data, on the other hand, show that DBS has a wide range of impacts on many distinct cortical and subcortical sites. Notably, the nonlinear reaction???diffusion multiscale mathematical models demonstrate the effectiveness of capturing crucial disease characteristics and are used to simulate large-scale brain activity. The BG and associated nuclei comprise many subcortical cell groups in the brain, and their couplings commonly revealed MRI-based assessments of the strength of anatomical connections. We have developed a hybrid modeling formalism and a unique co-simulation technique that allows us to compute electrodiffusive ion dynamics for the cortex???BG???thalamus (BGTH) brain network model within a large-scale brain connectome. We collect data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and propose a closed-loop DBS approach based on the brain network model. Moreover, we select regions in the parameter space that reflect the healthy and Parkinsonian states as well as the impact of DBS on the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) neurons. We predicted that if we apply the DBS to the system described by the temporal model, the brain maintains a healthy state until 0.05ms for STN neurons and 0.035ms for GPi neurons. A local regulatory mechanism known as feedback inhibition control (FIC) points to the existence of underlying network dynamics in the white matter of connected brain regions. The model showed unanticipated effects that in the presence of diffusion, the human brain maintained a healthy state for a long time after the DBS had been applied to STN and GPi neurons. This research helps us better understand the changes in brain activity caused by DBS and enhances this clinical therapy, thus shedding new light on the importance of DBS mechanisms in BGTH brain network models of neurodegenerative disorders.},

Improving the practice of scholarship is a common goal of the open science, open source, and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) communities and research software is now being understood as a type of digital object to which FAIR should be applied. This emergence reflects a maturation of the research community to better understand the crucial role of FAIR research software in maximising research value. The FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group has adapted the FAIR Guiding Principles to create the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles). The contents and context of the FAIR4RS Principles are summarised here to provide the basis for discussion of their adoption.
