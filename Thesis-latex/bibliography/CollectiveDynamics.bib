A promising way toexplore various protective measures and to estimate thepotential benefits and costs of a variety of options is touse computer modeling.

We calibrate andapply our model to simulate the COVID-19 epidemicsituation in the city of Muenster, Germany. We imple-ment our model on top of various locomotion modelsin the Vadere simulation framework. Experiments withour approach show that social distancing can reduce thepeak attack rates by up to 85 Percent, while self-isolation orhousehold quarantine can have a significant impact bydelaying the epidemic peak. Furthermore, combining so-cial distancing, self-quarantine and school closures cangreatly mitigate the spread of the epidemic.},

 abstract = {We study a simple traffic model with a non-signalized road intersection. In this model the car arriving from the right has precedence. The vehicle dynamics far from the crossing are governed by the rules introduced by Nagel and Paczuski, which define how drivers behave when braking or accelerating. We measure the average velocity of the ensemble of cars and its flow as a function of the density of cars on the roadway. An additional set of rules is defined to describe the dynamics at the intersection assuming a fraction of drivers that do not obey the rule of precedence. This problem is treated within a game-theory framework, where the drivers that obey the rule are cooperators and those who ignore it are defectors. We study the consequences of these behaviors as a function of the fraction of cooperators and defectors. The results show that cooperation is the best strategy because it maximizes the flow of vehicles and minimizes the number of accidents. A rather paradoxical effect is observed: for any percentage of defectors the number of accidents is larger when the density of cars is low because of the higher average velocity.},

 abstract = {In walking analysis, which is one useful method for efficient physical rehabilitation, the ground reaction force, the center of pressure, and the body orientation data are measured during walking. In the past, these data were measured by a 3D motion analysis system consisting of high-speed cameras and force plates, which must be installed in the floor. However, a conventional 3D motion analysis system can measure the ground reaction force and the center of pressure just on force plates during a few steps. In addition, the subjects' stride lengths are limited because they have to walk on the center of the force plate. These problems can be resolved by converting conventional devices into wearable devices. We used a measuring device consisting of portable force plates and motion sensors. We developed a walking analysis system that calculates the ground reaction force, the center of pressure, and the body orientations and measured a walking subject to estimate this system. We simultaneously used a conventional 3D motion analysis system to compare with our development system and showed its validity for measurements of ground reaction force and the center of pressure.},

@article{adam-2016-cdyn,
 abstract = {Modelling and simulation have long been dominated by equation-based approaches, until the recent advent of agent-based approaches. To curb the resulting complexity of models, Axelrod promoted the KISS principle: 'Keep It Simple, Stupid'. But the community is divided and a new principle appeared: KIDS, 'Keep It Descriptive, Stupid'. Richer models were thus developed for a variety of phenomena, while agent cognition still tends to be modelled with simple reactive particle-like agents. This is not always appropriate, in particular in the social sciences trying to account for the complexity of human behaviour. One solution is to model humans as belief, desire and intention (BDI) agents, an expressive paradigm using concepts from folk psychology, making it easier for modellers and users to understand the simulation. This paper provides a methodological guide to the use of BDI agents in social simulations, and an overview of existing methodologies and tools for using them.},

The idea is based on a previous study suggesting that a guiding system in front of an entrance can reduce pushing of the waiting people and thus the density at the entrance. In our study we aim to find out to what extend the corridor width has an impact on crowding or queuing behavior and with that on the density. The results of the presented experiment suggest that the transition takes place between a corridor width of 1.2 m and 2.3 m. The total duration of each experimental run is not significantly influenced by the corridor width but by the width of the entrance itself, the number of participants and partly by the motivation. In general, the density in front of the gate as well as the area of high density is increased by widening the corridor and by intensifying the motivation of the participants. However, the results also suggest that also the number of participants significantly influences the occurrence of pushing and the level of density.},

 abstract = {It is known that ants learn long visually guided routes through complex terrain. However, the mechanisms by which visual information is first learned and then used to control a route direction are not well understood. In this article, we propose a parsimonious mechanism for visually guided route following. We investigate whether a simple approach, involving scanning the environment and moving in the direction that appears most familiar, can provide a model of visually guided route learning in ants. We implement view familiarity as a means of navigation by training a classifier to determine whether a given view is part of a route and using the confidence in this classification as a proxy for familiarity. Through the coupling of movement and viewing direction, a familiar view specifies a familiar direction of viewing and thus a familiar movement to make. We show the feasibility of our approach as a model of ant-like route acquisition by learning a series of nontrivial routes through an indoor environment using a large gantry robot equipped with a panoramic camera.},

Desert ants are particularly impressive navigators, able to rapidly learn long, visually guided foraging routes. Their elegant behaviours provide inspiration to biomimetic engineers and for psychologists demonstrate the minimal mechanistic requirements for complex spatial behaviours. In this spirit, we have developed a parsimonious model of route navigation that captures many of the known properties of ants routes. Our model uses a neural network trained with the visual scenes experienced along a route to assess the familiarity of any view. Subsequent route navigation involves a simple behavioural routine, in which the simulated ant scans the world and moves in the most familiar direction, as determined by the network. The algorithm exhibits both place-search and route navigation using the same mechanism. Crucially, in our model it is not necessary to specify when or what to learn, nor separate routes into sequences of waypoints; thereby providing proof of concept that route navigation can be achieved without these elements. As such, we believe it represents the only detailed and complete model of insect route guidance to date.},

However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one.},

The cases in which these activities have been systematically integrated for a mutual benefit are still very few compared to the corpus of crowd related literature. This paper presents a case study of an integrated approach to the definition of an innovative model for pedestrian and crowd simulation (on the side of synthesis) that was actually motivated and supported by the analyses of empirical data acquired from both experimental settings and observations in real world scenarios. In particular, we will introduce a model for the adaptive behaviour of pedestrians that are also members of groups, that strive to maintain their cohesion even in difficult (e.g., high density) situations.

 abstract = {Pedestrian simulation models based on Cellular Automata are viable alternatives to particle based approaches, employing a continuous spatial representation. The effects of discretisation, however, also imply some difficulties in modelling phenomena observed in reality. This paper focuses on the possibility to manage heterogeneity in the walking speed of the simulated population of pedestrians by modifying an existing model extending the floor field approach. Whereas some discrete models allow pedestrians (or cars, when applied to traffic modelling) to move more than a single cell per time step, the present work proposes a maximum speed of one cell per step, but we model lower speeds by having pedestrians yielding their movement in some turns. Different classes of pedestrians are associated to different desired walking speeds and a stochastic mechanism is defined to ensure that they maintain an average speed close to the desired one. The paper formally describes the model and the results of its application in benchmark scenarios. Finally, the paper shows how this approach can also support the definition of slopes and stairs as elements reducing the walking speed of pedestrians climbing them in a simulated scenario.},

Handles different speeds in a cellular automaton, I think, by letting fast agents hop more often. Not aware of our old publications on the same subject. Introduces a stairs model that uses a reduced speed instead of using the natural advantage of the cells to do somthing that resembles true climbing of stairs as in the OSM.

Affiliation, activated by threat, results in individuals seeking the proximity of attachment figures (i.e. family members, friends, colleagues, strangers, social groups, familiar places, and objects). This affects the actions, directions, and speeds adopted by individuals seeking safe areas. This paper presents SOLACE, a multi-agent model of human behaviour during seismic crisis based on social attachment theory. SOLACE is an attempt to show the effect of social attachment on the number of victims, and the time that it takes, to reach a safe area; this increases the realism in evacuation modelling. Real-geographic data are used to define the spatial context of the crisis environment, delimit mobility with barriers (e.g. buildings, debris), and constrain movement to freespace. A belief, desire, and intention (BDI) approach was adopted to integrate social bonds in human agent interaction and mobility. Initial results include realism in: (1) the synthetic crisis environment indicated by a power law distribution of earthquake effects: (a) intensities on buildings and shaking felt by human agents, and (b) evacuation delay, (2) agent movement and interaction (e.g. parent with child) influencing speed of evacuation.},

@article{barton-2015-cdyn,
 abstract = {When walking over complex terrain, humans use visual information about the upcoming ground surface layout to exploit the passive physical forces inherent to bipedal locomotion. We previously showed that visual information about potential target footholds for an upcoming step is critical for control during the end of the preceding step. Visual information about target position presented during this critical control phase was sufficient for subjects to accurately step to a target, while the same information presented before or after the critical phase resulted in less accurate foot placement. Although visual information about target position is not essential once the step to that target is initiated, it remains unclear whether humans are capable of using such information to improve stepping accuracy following a perturbation during that step. Reynolds and Day (2005) demonstrated that, when taking a single step, participants rapidly respond to changes in target position while the foot is in flight. However, it is not known whether humans exhibit such active corrections during continuous walking over longer stretches of complex terrain, when locomotion is largely under passive control. In the present study, subjects walked along a path of irregularly spaced targets projected onto the ground while their movements were recorded with motion capture. As subjects approached targets, each target briefly disappeared and then reappeared. On a subset of trials, the location of one of the six targets was perturbed in either a medial-lateral or anterior-posterior direction while invisible. Subjects' responses to the perturbation depended on the timing of visual information during that step. Discussion focuses on the contributions of active control, to respond to perturbations during the swing phase, and passive control, to efficiently adapt the gait cycle to upcoming terrain.},

These matrices are important input for infrastructure management both for pedestrian flow simulations in the planning stage as well as crowd control in the real-time application. Estimation is based on explicit models for the temporal dependence for long-term observations, where the models are adapted from the dynamic freeway OD-matrix estimation approach. Since pedestrian counts currently are subject to non-negligible measurement errors, the estimation uses the generalised method of moments estimation scheme to account for the errors-in-variables problem. Assumptions under which the method produces consistent and asymptotically normal estimators are provided, which are in line with empirically derived characteristics of pedestrian counters. In addition an approximation is provided, which shows superior finite sample properties in return for an asymptotic bias. The suitability of the method is demonstrated using a simulation study as well as a real-world application.},

@article{becker-2001-cdyn,
 abstract = {This article surveys a general approach to error control and adaptive mesh design in Galerkin finite element methods that is based on duality principles as used in optimal control. Most of the existing work on a posteriori error analysis deals with error estimation in global norms like the energy norm or the L2 norm, involving usually unknown stability constants. However, in most applications, the error in a global norm does not provide useful bounds for the errors in the quantities of real physical interest. Further, their sensitivity to local error sources is not properly represented by global stability constants. These deficiencies are overcome by employing duality techniques, as is common in a priori error analysis of finite element methods, and replacing the global stability constants by computationally obtained local sensitivity factors. Combining this with Galerkin orthogonality, a posteriori estimates can be derived directly for the error in the target quantity. In these estimates local residuals of the computed solution are multiplied by weights which measure the dependence of the error on the local residuals. Those, in turn, can be controlled by locally refining or coarsening the computational mesh. The weights are obtained by approximately solving a linear adjoint problem. The resulting a posteriori error estimates provide the basis of a feedback process for successively constructing economical meshes and corresponding error bounds tailored to the particular goal of the computation. This approach, called the dual-weighted-residual method, is introduced initially within an abstract functional analytic setting, and is then developed in detail for several model situations featuring the characteristic properties of elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic problems. After having discussed the basic properties of duality-based adaptivity, we demonstrate the potential of this approach by presenting a selection of results obtained for practical test cases. These include problems from viscous fluid flow, chemically reactive flow, elasto-plasticity, radiative transfer, and optimal control. Throughout the paper, open theoretical and practical problems are stated together with references to the relevant literature.},

It can be observed in many animals, such as bird flocks, shoals or herds of ungulates. Spatial attraction between humans as the central component of flocking behaviour has been simulated in a number of seminal models but it has not been detected experimentally in human groups so far. The two other sub-processes of this self-organised collective movement -- collision avoidance and alignment -- are excluded or held constant respectively in this study. We created a computer-based, multi-agent game where human players, represented as black dots, moved on a virtual playground. The participants were deprived of social cues about each other and could neither communicate verbally nor nonverbally. They played two games: (1) Single Game, where other players were invisible, and (2) Joint Game, where each player could see players' positions in a local radius around himself/herself. We found that individuals approached their neighbours spontaneously if their positions were visible, leading to less spatial dispersion of the whole group compared to moving alone. We conclude that human groups show the basic component of flocking behaviour without being explicitly instructed or rewarded to do so.},

 abstract = {When we are walking in crowds, we mainly use visual information to avoid collisions with other pedestrians. Thus, gaze activity should be considered to better understand interactions between people in a crowd. In this work, we use Virtual Reality (VR) to facilitate motion and gaze tracking, as well as to accurately control experimental conditions, in order to study the effect of crowd density on eye-gaze behavior. Our motivation is to better understand how interaction neighborhood (i.e., the subset of people actually influencing one's locomotion trajectory) changes with density. To this end, we designed two experiments. The first one evaluates the biases introduced by the use of VR on the visual activity when walking among people, by comparing eye-gaze activity while walking in a real and virtual street. We then designed a second experiment where participants walked in a virtual street with different levels of pedestrian density. We demonstrate that gaze fixations are performed at the same frequency despite increases in pedestrian density, while the eyes scan a narrower portion of the street. These results suggest that in such situations walkers focus more on people in front and closer to them. These results provide valuable insights regarding eye-gaze activity during interactions between people in a crowd, and suggest new recommendations in designing more realistic crowd simulations.},

 abstract = {This paper is devoted to the modeling of the pedestrian dynamics by means of the thermostatted kinetic theory. Specifically the microscopic interactions among pedestrians and an external force field are modeled for simulating the evacuation of pedestrians from a metro station. The fundamentals of the stochastic game theory and the thermostatted kinetic theory are coupled for the derivation of a specific mathematical model which depicts the time evolution of the distribution of pedestrians at different exits of a metro station. The perturbation theory is employed in order to establish the stability analysis of the nonequilibrium stationary states in the case of a metro station consisting of two exits. A general sensitivity analysis on the initial conditions, the magnitude of the external force field and the number of exits is presented by means of numerical simulations which, in particular, show how the asymptotic distribution and the convergence time are affected by the presence of an external force field. The results show how, in evacuation conditions, the interaction dynamics among pedestrians can be negligible with respect to the external force. The important role of the thermostat term in allowing the reaching of the nonequilibrium stationary state is stressed out. Research perspectives are underlined at the end of paper, in particular for what concerns the derivation of frameworks that take into account the definition of local external actions and the introduction of the space and velocity dynamics.},

Each scale has individual characteristics according to spatial resolution and computational efficiency. Our approach combines these scales to model multimodal aspects of mobilityduring an event course. For the macroscopic scale, a public transport approach, which combines network based optimization with simulation techniques, is presented. This optimization approach for bus transport was integrated into a crowd simulation platform, which simulates the behavior of visitors after having arrived at the event site.},

 abstract = {The collective behaviour of human crowds emerges from the local interactions of individuals. To understand human crowds we therefore need to identify the behavioural rules individual pedestrians follow. This is crucial for the control of emergency evacuations from confined spaces, for example. At a microscopic level we seek to predict the next step of pedestrians based on their local environment. However, we also have to consider 'tactical-level' individual behaviour that is not an immediate response to the local environment, such as the choice between different routes to exit a building. We used an interactive virtual environment to study human exit route decisions in simulated evacuations. Participants had to escape from a building and had to choose between different exit routes in the presence of evacuating simulated agents. We found no inherent preference for familiar routes, but under a stress-inducing treatment, subjects were more likely to display behaviour in their route choice that was detrimental to their evacuation time. Most strikingly, subjects were less likely to avoid a congested exit by changing their original decision to move towards it under this treatment. Age and gender had clear effects on reaction times in the virtual environment.},

 abstract = {The evacuation of crowds from buildings or vehicles is one example that highlights the importance of understanding how individual-level interactions and decision-making combine and lead to the overall behaviour of crowds. In particular, to make evacuations safer, we need to understand how individuals make movement decisions in crowds. Here, we present an evacuation experiment with over 500 participants testing individual behaviour in an interactive virtual environment. Participants had to choose between different exit routes under the influence of three different types of directional information: static information (signs), dynamic information (movement of simulated crowd) and memorized information, as well as the combined effect of these different sources of directional information. In contrast to signs, crowd movement and memorized information did not have a significant effect on human exit route choice in isolation. However, when we combined the latter two treatments with additional directly conflicting sources of directional information, for example signs, they showed a clear effect by reducing the number of participants that followed the opposing directional information. This suggests that the signals participants observe more closely in isolation do not simply overrule alternative sources of directional information. Age and gender did not consistently explain differences in behaviour in our experiments.},

 abstract = {The movement of animals in groups is widespread in nature. Understanding this phenomenon presents an important problem in ecology with many applications that range from conservation to robotics. Underlying all group movements are interactions between individual animals and it is therefore crucial to understand the mechanisms of this social behaviour. To date, despite promising methodological developments, there are few applications to data of practical statistical techniques that inferentially investigate the extent and nature of social interactions in group movement. We address this gap by demonstrating the usefulness of a Hidden Markov Model approach to characterise individual-level social movement in published trajectory data on three-spined stickleback shoals (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and novel data on guppy shoals (Poecilia reticulata). With these models, we formally test for speed-mediated social interactions and verify that they are present. We further characterise this inferred social behaviour and find that despite the substantial shoal-level differences in movement dynamics between species, it is qualitatively similar in guppies and sticklebacks. It is intermittent, occurring in varying numbers of individuals at different time points. The speeds of interacting fish follow a bimodal distribution, indicating that they are either stationary or move at a preferred mean speed, and social fish with more social neighbours move at higher speeds, on average. Our findings and methodology present steps towards characterising social behaviour in animal groups.},

 abstract = {Pedestrian dynamics is concerned with understanding the movement patterns that arise in places where more than one person walks. Relating theoretical models to data is a crucial goal of research in this field. Statistical model fitting and model selection are a suitable approach to this problem and here we review the concepts and literature related to this methodology in the context of pedestrian dynamics. The central tenet of statistical modelling is to describe the relationship between different variables by using probability distributions. Rather than providing a critique of existing methodology or a "how to" guide for such an established research technique, our review aims to highlight broad concepts, different uses, best practices, challenges and opportunities with a focussed view on theoretical models for pedestrian behaviour. This contribution is aimed at researchers in pedestrian dynamics who want to carefully analyse data, relate a theoretical model to data, or compare the relative quality of several theoretical models. The survey of the literature we present provides many methodological starting points and we suggest that the particular challenges to statistical modelling in pedestrian dynamics make this an inherently interesting field of research.},

The comparability of the results of these measurements is low, as the walking speed is influenced by a vast amount of parameters and no standardised measurement conditions exist. This work describes the most important factors influencing walking speed based on existing literature and estimates their impact. For this purpose, all walking speed measurements available in the literature were collected and reviewed. Using this data, the parameter values for different influences were computed and grouped according to their strength, which enables to determine the most important measurement parameters in future walking speed experiments. In addition, standardised measurement conditions are proposed which would provide a baseline for future studies and thus enhance their scientific value. For each of these conditions average walking speeds are calculated and the significance of the walking speed differences was determined.},

 abstract = {The pedestrian fundamental diagram, which describes the relationship between speed, flow and density, is one of the key concepts for the design of pedestrian facilities. It allows to determine the capacity of facilities as well as to calculate estimated walking times, for example when changing trains. In the last decades, laboratory and field measurements have been conducted to obtain the fundamental diagram for different situations. Based on this it was revealed that the fundamental diagram differs significantly between different locations and pedestrian compositions. Various parameters  which significantly influence the shape of the fundamental diagram curve have been determined. Thus, poor results might occur when using a general form of the fundamental diagram for design purpose. Still, only either fundamental diagrams measured in a single setting or ones aggregating these measurements are available. No comprehensive model was found which is able to describe the differences observed as well as being able to estimate fundamental diagrams for other pedestrian compositions. Currently, an estimation of a specific fundamental diagram without corresponding empirical data is not possible.

The idea of this thesis is to address this research gap by creating a generic model, which describes the main walking principles and the interaction between pedestrians. Using this model allows to generate situation specific fundamental diagrams. In addition, the underlying principles which determine the shape of the fundamental diagram are determined and the effect of different influence factors on human walking can be studied. By applying situation specific input parameter values, it shall be possible to generate situation specific fundamental diagrams useful for the design of pedestrian facilities.

The model creation was done in two steps. As a basis for the quantitative fundamental diagram model, a qualitative generic walking model was developed. A comprehensive overview of the basic principles of walking and the interaction of pedestrian was given in the generic walking model. This was done by combining individual findings available in literature. Starting from a simple case, where a pedestrian is walking alone at constant speed, the model is extended to include all relevant influences on a pedestrian.

The generic pedestrian walking model was then used as a basis for the fundamental diagram model. Here, a microscopic model was established where also the distribution of input parameter values can be simulated. Again, first a simple model was set up and complexity was added step by step. In the end a model was created based on lane movement of pedestrians, where lane swapping is possible to enable overtaking.

For the model setup, a thoroughly literature review was performed at the beginning of this work. A special focus was laid on the pedestrian walking speed. The different influences on the free flow walking speed were collected and their effect was estimated. In addition, a definition of the fundamental diagram useful for this work and a detailed discussion on the time aspect of the Level of Service concept, which is closely linked to the fundamental diagram, was made in connection to the literature review.

For the calibration and validation of the model, empirical data already available from experiments and real-life measurements was used. This allowed to cover a wide range of different setting in the validation. In conclusion, the validation showed that the model is expected to provide adequately accurate and useful results for the expected scope of application.

Using the model it was possible to accept the research question stating that it is possible to create a generic pedestrian fundamental diagram model. This can be used to estimate specific fundamental diagrams. However, it was found that although the model is based strongly on the basic principles of walking, the estimation of the input parameters can be challenging. Still, for experienced users it is expected that the model will provide better results than general fundamental diagrams currently used.

The validated model is ready to be used to estimate situation specific fundamental diagrams. This was done for different scenarios, for example for the expected situation in 2050 or to determine the effect of the mixture of commuters and shoppers on the pedestrian flow. In the future scenario it was shown that the assumed trends result in reduced walking speeds, especially at higher densities. Here, the model allows for the first time to evaluate the effect of different changes and the simulation of fundamental diagrams for situations, where no empirical data is available.},

To analyzepedestrian traffic on grandstands, experiments under laboratory conditions with up to 300 participants have been performed in the ESPRIT arena in Duesseldorf. Fieldstudies in the same stadium and the BORUSSIA-PARK in Moenchengladbach complement the experimental database. In the first partof the dissertation an extensive literature review of pedestrian dynamics on stairs is presented. Precise trajectories, extracted from own experiments, are used to derive the fundamental diagram. The spatial dependency of the basic quantities velocity, density and specific flow on stairs is analyzed. Various influences on the flow and density in the mouth - standing and seated terraces, different slope of the grandstand, positioning of security personnel - are quantified in the second part of the thesis. Based on this data and gained insights the last chapter deals with the validation of a computersimulation. It is clarified, which aspects have to be considered for the validation of a spatial-continuous model.

 abstract = {We propose a two-dimensional cellular automaton model to simulate pedestrian traffic. It is a vmax=1 model with exclusion statistics and parallel dynamics. Long-range interactions between the pedestrians are mediated by a so-called floor field which modifies the transition rates to neighbouring cells. This field, which can be discrete or continuous, is subject to diffusion and decay. Furthermore it can be modified by the motion of the pedestrians. Therefore, the model uses an idea similar to chemotaxis, but with pedestrians following a virtual rather than a chemical trace. Our main goal is to show that the introduction of such a floor field is sufficient to model collective effects and self-organization encountered in pedestrian dynamics, e.g. lane formation in counterflow through a large corridor. As an application we also present simulations of the evacuation of a large room with reduced visibility, e.g. due to failure of lights or smoke.},

 abstract = {We consider a self-propelled particle system which has been used to describe certain types of collective motion of animals, such as fish schools and bird flocks. Interactions between particles are specified by means of a pairwise potential, repulsive at short ranges and attractive at longer ranges. The exponentially decaying Morse potential is a typical choice, and is known to reproduce certain types of collective motion observed in nature, particularly aligned flocks and rotating mills. We introduce a class of interaction potentials, that we call Quasi-Morse, for which flock and rotating mills states are also observed numerically, however in that case the corresponding macroscopic equations allow for explicit solutions in terms of special functions, with coefficients that can be obtained numerically without solving the particle evolution. We compare the obtained solutions with long-time dynamics of the particle systems and find a close agreement for several types of flock and mill solutions.},

  abstract     = {Physical distancing, as a measure to contain the spreading of Covid-19, is defining a "new normal". Unless belonging to a family, pedestrians in shared spaces are asked to observe a minimal (country-dependent) pairwise distance. Coherently, managers of public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are: "in which conditions non-family members infringed social distancing?", "Are there repeated offenders?", and "How are new crowd management measures performing?". Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging. In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in real-time, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders and family members in a privacy-compliant way. Second, we present a thorough analysis of mutual distances and exposure-times in a Dutch train platform, comparing pre-Covid and current data via physics observables as Radial Distribution Functions. The versatility and simplicity of this approach, developed to analyze crowd management measures in public transport facilities, enable to tackle issues beyond physical distancing, for instance the privacy-respectful detection of groups and the analysis of their motion patterns.},

  abstract = {For robotic vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in pedestrian-rich environments, it is important to model subtle human behaviors and navigation rules (e.g., passing on the right). However, while instinctive to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due to the stochasticity in people's behaviors. Existing works are mostly focused on using feature-matching techniques to describe and imitate human paths, but often do not generalize well since the feature values can vary from person to person, and even run to run. This work notes that while it is challenging to directly specify the details of what to do (precise mechanisms of human navigation), it is straightforward to specify what not to do (violations of social norms). Specifically, using deep reinforcement learning, this work develops a time-efficient navigation policy that respects common social norms. The proposed method is shown to enable fully autonomous navigation of a robotic vehicle moving at human walking speed in an environment with many pedestrians.},

Thus pedestrian movement dynamics on stairways has attracted researchers from different disciplines. As a result of the geometric constraints of the stairs, pedestrian movement features on stairways are different from level ambulation. However, most current modeling pedestrian models for stairway movement have not taken into account the constraints of stairs. In the present study, a computer simulation model named Pedestrian Footstep Model is formulated. In this model, the tread depth and riser height together determine a pedestrian's footstep length, which finally affects the actual movement speed that a pedestrian can achieve. In this way, the model cannot only simulate pedestrian movement on stairs but also on horizontal ground. Dynamics of pedestrian crowd movement process are explored considering different stair geometry features, floor height and flow situations.},

 abstract = {An extended floor field model was proposed to investigate evacuation behaviors of pedestrians under the threat of artificial attack. In this model, pedestrian movement governed by the static and dynamic floor field, and the motion and assault of artificial attacker were involved simultaneously. Further, injuries with lower velocity and deaths of pedestrians caused by the attacker during evacuation were considered. And a new parameter ktwas introduced. It is the sensitivity coefficient of attack threat floor field and could reflect quantitatively the extent of effect of attack threat on the decision-making of the individual. Moreover, effects of several key parameters such as the sensitivity coefficient, assault intensity and pedestrian density on evacuation dynamics were studied. Results show that pedestrian evacuation would display interesting phenomena transiting from rolling behavior to along-the-wall motion with aggravating extent of the impact of attackers on pedestrians, which refers ktin the model varying from 0.5 to 0.8. As assault intensity increases, more casualties would be caused and the available evacuation time would decrease, which means people have to flee the room in a shorter time period for survival. When the pedestrian density increases, more clogging at the exit would be generated and pedestrians would be more difficult to evacuate due to the limited capacity of egress and the reduction in the average speed of pedestrian flow caused by the injured. And the injured with limited motion capacity could hardly complete the evacuation owing to that they need more evacuation time and would retard the speed of the pedestrian flow.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this study was to collect and analyze individual unimpeded stair ascent and descent walk speeds for the Korean population. To collect these data, a full-scale experiment was conducted in a 50-storey residential building in Korea involving 30 male and 30 female participants with an average age of 23.4 years. Each participant was required to ascend 50 floors and after a suitable rest period was then required to descend 50 floors using the stairs. Arrival times on each floor were recorded using video cameras, allowing floor by floor walk speeds to be determined and to assess whether fatigue affected the descent/ascent. The average descent speed for the male and female population was 0.83 m/s and 0.74 m/s, respectively, while the average ascent speed was 0.66 m/s and 0.48 m/s. However, there was no significant relationship between body mass index and stair walk speed or unimpeded horizontal walk speed and stair walk speed. During the descent, 50% of the population displayed a decrease in the walk speed over the final half of the descent with a maximum decrease of some 19%. However, some 50% of the population increased their travel speed during the final half of the descent. During the ascent, all participants decreased their speed over the first 20 floors by an average of approximately 60%. Implications of these findings for evacuation modeling/simulation are discussed.},

Therefore, vehicular traffic, modeled as a system of interacting particles driven far from equilibrium, offers the possibility to study various fundamental aspects of truly nonequilibrium systems which are of current interest in statistical physics. Analytical as well as numerical techniques of statistical physics are being used to study these models to understand rich variety of physical phenomena exhibited by vehicular traffic. Some of these phenomena, observed in vehicular traffic under different circumstances, include transitions from one dynamical phase to another, criticality and self-organized criticality, metastability and hysteresis, phase-segregation, etc. In this critical review, written from the perspective of statistical physics, we explain the guiding principles behind all the main theoretical approaches. But we present detailed discussions on the results obtained mainly from the so-called particle-hopping models, particularly emphasizing those which have been formulated in recent years using the language of cellular automata.},

This is the first time that such methods are studied from the point of view of parallel computing. We studied and implemented an implicit numerical method for solving the high-order flow conservation traffic model on parallel computers. Implicit methods allow much larger time-step than explicit methods, for the same accuracy. However, at each time-step a nonlinear system must be solved. We used the Newton method coupled with a linear iterative method (Orthomin). We accelerated the convergence of Orthomin with parallel incomplete \{LU\} factorization preconditionings. We ran simulation tests with real traffic data from an 12-mile freeway section (in Minnesota) on the nCUBE2 parallel computer. These tests gave the same accuracy as past tests, which were performed on one-processor computers, and the overall execution time was significantly reduced.},

 abstract = {In this article, we present a microscopic-discrete mathematical model describing crowd dynamics in no panic conditions. More specifically, pedestrians are set to move in order to reach a target destination and their movement is influenced by both behavioral strategies and physical forces. Behavioral strategies include individual desire to remain sufficiently far from structural elements (walls and obstacles) and from other walkers, while physical forces account for interpersonal collisions. The resulting pedestrian behavior emerges therefore from non-local, anisotropic and short/long-range interactions. Relevant improvements of our mathematical model with respect to similar microscopic-discrete approaches present in the literature are: (i) each pedestrian has his/her own dynamic gazing direction, which is regarded to as an independent degree of freedom and (ii) each walker is allowed to take dynamic strategic decisions according to his/her environmental awareness, which increases due to new information acquired on the surrounding space through their visual region. The resulting mathematical modeling environment is then applied to specific scenarios that, although simplified, resemble real-word situations. In particular, we focus on pedestrian flow in two-dimensional buildings with several structural elements (i.e., corridors, divisors and columns, and exit doors). The noticeable heterogeneity of possible applications demonstrates the potential of our mathematical model in addressing different engineering problems, allowing for optimization issues as well.},

 abstract = {The possibility to understand and to quantitatively model the physics of the interactions between pedestrians walking in crowds has compelling relevant applications, e.g. related to the design and safety of civil infrastructures. In this work we study pedestrian-pedestrian interactions from observational experimental data in diluted crowds. While in motion, pedestrians adapt their walking paths trying to preserve mutual comfort distances and to avoid collisions. In mathematical models this behavior is typically modeled via "social" interaction forces.
Leveraging on a high-quality, high-statistics dataset - composed of few millions of real-life trajectories acquired from state-of-the-art observational experiments - we develop a quantitative model capable of addressing interactions in the case of binary collision avoidance. We model interactions in terms of both long- and short-range forces, which we superimpose to our Langevin model for non-interacting pedestrian motion [Corbetta et al. Phys.Rev.E 95, 032316, 2017]. The new model that we propose here features a Langevin dynamics with "fast" random velocity fluctuations that are superimposed to the "slow" dynamics of a hidden model variable: the "intended" walking path. The model is capable of reproducing relevant statistics of the collision avoidance motion, such as the statistics of the side displacement and of the passing speed. Rare occurrences of bumping events are also recovered.
Furthermore, comparing with large datasets of real-life tracks involves an additional challenge so far neglected: identifying, within a database containing very heterogeneous conditions, only the relevant events corresponding to binary avoidance interactions. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach based on a graph representation of pedestrian trajectories, which allows us to operate complexity reduction for efficient data selection.},

 abstract = {This study provides a novel observational method to observe repetitive seating
patterns chosen by students in a classroom. Although prior work that
relied on self-reports suggests that students claim the same seats repeatedly,
the main hypothesis of the study was that in a repeated use of a public
space, people tend to occupy the same position, thus establishing a form of
territoriality. Student seating locations were observed in two university lecture
halls, 6 times during a span of 4 weeks. Observations were carried out
on a sample of 47 and 31 students for Lecture Halls A and B, respectively.
Two parameters were computed: mean displacement and mean territory
dimension. The results showed very low mean displacements in both halls
and the establishment of very small territories inside the halls. The results
are explained in terms of conflict and anxiety avoidance, and the interaction
between spatial preference and goal fulfillment driven by motivational and
personality factors.},

This last topic is addressed in this paper. We propose an original enhancement of a well known physics-based animation model which allows to consider influence of gaseous phenomena such as smoke or toxic gases in the behavior of the crowd. In order to get real time performances we also propose an implementation of this framework on modern graphics hardware, which allows to simulate crowds of thousands individuals at interactive framerate.},

We reveal the existence of major group-level behavioural transitions related to minor changes in individual-level interactions. Further, we present the first evidence for collective memory in such animal groups (where the previous history of group structure influences the collective behaviour exhibited as individual interactions change) during the transition of a group from one type of collective behaviour to another. The model is then used to show how differences among individuals influence group structure, and how individuals employing simple, local rules of thumb, can accurately change their spatial position within a group (e.g. to move to the centre, the front, or the periphery) in the absence of information on their current position within the group as a whole. These results are considered in the context of the evolution and ecological importance of animal groups.},

 abstract = {Publisher Summary The chapter discusses an emerging area of study: that of applying self-organization theory to mobile vertebrate groups composed of many interacting individuals such as bird flocks, ungulate herds, fish schools, and human crowds in an attempt to improve our understanding of underlying organizational principles. Mathematical modeling is becoming increasingly recognized as an important research tool when studying collective behavior. The chapter presents the interaction dynamics among individuals result in the formation, internal structuring, and collective behaviors of vertebrate groups. The chapter explores the distribution of grouping individuals over larger spatial and temporal scales, and discusses how individual behaviors lead to population-level dynamics. Behavioral differences among individuals within a group may have an important internal structuring influence. By using simulation models, it can be shown how individuals can modify their positions relative to other group members without necessitating information about their current position within the group. In considering self-organization within vertebrate groups it is evident that the organization at one level, for example, that of the group relates to that at higher levels. For example, self-sorting processes that lead to internal structuring within groups also result in population-level patterns when such groups fragment, thus affecting the probability that an individual will be in a group of a given size and composition at any moment in time. These population properties then feed back to the individual interactions by changing the probability of encounters among different members of a population. The chapter concludes that to understand collective behaviors fully, these properties cannot necessarily be considered in isolation.},

 abstract = {For animals that forage or travel in groups, making movement decisions often depends on social interactions among group members. However, in many cases, few individuals have pertinent information, such as knowledge about the location of a food source or of a migration route. Using a simple model we show how information can be transferred within groups both without signalling and when group members do not know which individuals, if any, have information. We reveal that the larger the group the smaller the proportion of informed individuals needed to guide the group, and that only a very small proportion of informed individuals is required to achieve great accuracy. We also demonstrate how groups can make consensus decisions, even though informed individuals do not know whether they are in a majority or minority, how the quality of their information compares with that of others, or even whether there are any other informed individuals. Our model provides new insights into the mechanisms of effective leadership and decision-making in biological systems.},

The background idea is indeed that most of the complex trends exhibited by crowds are due to an intrinsic interplay between individual and collective behaviors. The modeling approach promoted in this book pursues actively this intuition and profits from it for designing general mathematical structures susceptible of application also in fields different from the inspiring original one. The book considers also the two most traditional points of view: the microscopic one, in which pedestrians are tracked individually and the macroscopic one, in which pedestrians are assimilated to a continuum. Selected existing models are critically analyzed. The work is addressed to researchers and graduate students.},

The Tawaf serves as a unique test case; the large crowd consists of a heterogeneous set of pilgrims, varying in both physical capacity and activity. Furthermore, the density of the crowd reaches extremely high levels (up to 8 people/m2). This extreme density can place impractical constraints on simulation parameters. We use a velocity-space-based pedestrian model which exhibits consistent results even under extreme density: reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVO). Furthermore, we extend RVO to include priority and right of way-agents respond to potential collisions asymmetrically depending on context; one agent may yield, to varying degrees, to another. Our system uses a finite state machine to specify the behavior of the agents at each time step, to model the varied behaviors seen during the Tawaf. The finite-state machine, used in conjunction with RVO, generates collision-free trajectories for tens of thousands of agents in the performance of the Tawaf. The overall system can model agents with varying age, gender and behaviors, supporting the heterogeneity observed in the performance of the Tawaf, even at high densities.},

Right of way is a general principle, which can be applied to different types of pedestrianmodels.We illustrate this by applying right of way to three different pedestrian models (two based on social forces and one based on velocity obstacles) and show its impact in multiple scenarios.

 abstract = {This thesis describes the developement of a new type of simulation tool for the assessment of designs of public transport facilities (stations, airports) and other public spaces with intensive pedestrian flows. Since the available space for such facilities is increasingly under pressure, the space efficiency and walking comfort is becoming more and more important. The developed simulation tool provides designers and decision-makers with all kinds of quantitative information about the expected quality of pedestrian (traffic) flows such as travel times, waiting times, queue building, preferred routes, visits to shops and counters, etc. This information is very useful in comparing multiple designs as well as to optimise a specific design. The simulation model also is meant to improve schedules of public transport services at interchange nodes by minimising passenger transfer times. To that end, special attention is paid to the modelling of boarding and alighting processes. New insights about walking have been gained by performing unique large-scale laboratory experiments in which large groups of subjects were assigned various walking tasks, such as high volume crossing flows and walking through bottlenecks until flow breaks down. Specific walking and route choice models are developed using observations of passengers on platforms (such as in Delft) and route choice through the station (such as in Delft and Breda). The tool has proven its value in the analysis of new designs of the future Rotterdam Central Station and performance tests of the new Breskens-Vlissingen ferry terminals.},

 abstract = {This paper discusses the validity of first-order traffic flow theory for the description of two-dimensional pedestrian flow operations in the case of an oversaturated bottleneck in front of which a large high-density region has formed. The paper shows how observations of density, speed, and flow that have been collected from laboratory walking experiments can be interpreted from the viewpoint of first-order theory. It is observed that pedestrians present at the same cross section inside of the congested region may encounter different flow conditions. This mainly depends on the lateral position of the pedestrian with respect to the center of the congested region. In the lateral center, high densities and low speeds are observed. However, on the boundary of the congested region, pedestrians may walk in nearly free-flow conditions and literally walk around this congested region. Visualization of these data in the flow-density plane results in a large scatter of points that have similar flows (bottleneck capacity) but different densities. This can be explained by noticing that observations of congestion of pedestrian traffic over the total width of the cross section do not belong to a single fundamental diagram but belong to a set of different fundamental diagrams. This observation has consequences for estimation of the fundamental diagram describing pedestrian traffic.},

 abstract = {People die or get injured at mass events when the crowd gets out of control. Urbanization and the increasing popularity of mass events, from soccer games to religious celebrations, enforce this trend. Thus, there is a strong need to better control crowd behavior. Here, simulation of pedestrian streams can be very helpful: Simulations allow a user to run through a number of scenarios in a critical situation and thereby to investigate adequate measures to improve security. In order to make realistic, reliable predictions, a model must be able to reproduce the data known from experiments quantitatively. Therefore, automatic and fast calibration methods are needed that can easily adapt model parameters to different scenarios. Also, the model must be robust. Small changes or measurement errors in the crucial input parameters must not lead to disproportionally large changes in the simulation outcome and thus potentially useless results. In this paper we present two methods to automatically calibrate pedestrian simulations to the socio-cultural parameters captured through measured fundamental diagrams. We then introduce a concept of robustness to compare the two methods. In particular, we propose a quantitative estimation of parameter quality and a method of parameter selection based on a criterion for robustness. We discuss the results of our test scenarios and, based on our experience, propose further steps.},

 abstract = {Building a reliable predictive model of pedestrian motion is very challenging: Ideally, such models should be based on observations made in both controlled experiments and in real-world environments. De facto, models are rarely based on real-world observations due to the lack of available data; instead, they are largely based on intuition and, at best, literature values and laboratory experiments. Such an approach is insufficient for reliable simulations of complex real-life scenarios: For instance, our analysis of pedestrian motion under natural conditions at a major German railway station reveals that the values for free-flow velocities and the flow-density relationship differ significantly from widely used literature values. It is thus necessary to calibrate and validate the model against relevant real-life data to make it capable of reproducing and predicting real-life scenarios. In this work we aim at constructing such realistic pedestrian stream simulation. Based on the analysis of real-life data, we present a methodology that identifies key parameters and interdependencies that enable us to properly calibrate the model. The success of the approach is demonstrated for a benchmark model, a cellular automaton. We show that the proposed approach significantly improves the reliability of the simulation and hence the potential prediction accuracy. The simulation is validated by comparing the local density evolution of the measured data to that of the simulated data. We find that for our model the most sensitive parameters are: the source-target distribution of the pedestrian trajectories, the schedule of pedestrian appearances in the scenario and the mean free-flow velocity. Our results emphasize the need for real-life data extraction and analysis to enable predictive simulations.},

 abstract = {This thesis presents a new model for pedestrian motion and navigation: the Gradient
Navigation Model. It is based on an ODE system where a superposition of gradients
of distance functions changes the direction and length of the velocity vector. A
one-dimensional accelerative term is used to smooth sudden changes in speed. The
approach differs fundamentally from force based models where the acceleration is affected
by forces and in turn changes the velocity.
In the new model, virtual pedestrians navigate along geodesics computed by solving
the Eikonal equation. By directly changing the velocity, the behaviour of individual
pedestrians can be controlled in great detail. This leads to more natural trajectories
and avoids model induced oscillations completely. The model is calibrated by theoretical
arguments based on empirically validated assumptions. All functions included in
the model are presented with smooth dependency on their arguments. This enables a
proof of existence and uniqueness of the solution to the ODE system. The use of fast
and accurate high order numerical integrators is simplified as well.
An implementation of the model in Java is used to validate it against empirical
data. The emergence of several empirically observed system phenomena in various
geometries is shown, such as obstacle avoidance and congestions at bottlenecks. The
parameter set is held constant throughout all tests.
A comparison to the Social Force Model [Helbing and Molnar, 1995] and the Optimal
Steps Model [Seitz and Koester, 2012] reveals that the GNM outperforms them in
terms of oscillatory behaviour and overlapping (SFM) as well as possibilities of mathematical
analysis (OSM).},

enforcing behavior and behavior generating norms. Current modeling tools often only consider one or the

adhere to institutional norms, or analyze the emergence of global behavior resulting from 'free' individual

An ethnographic study of the No M11 Link Road Campaign in London examines participants' definitions of their collective identity boundaries at different stages of involvement. Cross-sectional material from the beginning and later in the campaign shows that there was a transformation in collective identity boundaries towards a more inclusive definition of community. Analysis of participants' accounts before and after involvement in the eviction of a tree suggests the role of conflict with the police in producing an oppositional definition of the collective identity, facilitating links to other groups in resistance to illegitimate authority. Finally, biographical material indicates the implications of transformed identity boundaries for co-action with wider social groups. It is argued that the same intra- and inter-group processes that determine how identity boundaries extend to include a broader community might account for how people come to see themselves as part of a global social movement.},

We examined the extent to which crowds are represented in UK emergency planning guidance as psychologically vulnerable or as contributing to psychosocial resilience. A systematic search of 47 guidance documents identified 9 referring to 'panic'. These were discourse analysed, along with six more guidance documents considered key to civil contingencies resilience. It was found that the references to 'panic' served to construct collectives (and particularly crowds) as a source of psychological vulnerability. References to collective sources of resilience in the public were mostly found to be limited and often served to marginalise the crowd as a basis of coping in emergencies. We argue that the emphasis in the current guidance on the marginal role of crowds and the indispensable role of the professionals conflicts with aspects of current policy on community resilience.},

 abstract = {Research on crowd behaviour has long transcended the narrow obsession with violence that marked its origins [1,2]. Today, studies are much more representative of the variety of crowd events and phenomena. The concern with understanding collective violence still remains a significant strand. Yet the emergence and development of the social identity approach has meant that the limiting assumptions of mindlessness that have hampered psychology in the past have given way to novel insights in the study of crowd conflict as well as in relation to numerous peaceful and less dramatic crowd events. This review of recent developments in research on the psychology of crowds and collective behaviour is divided into four areas. The first two sections cover the most well-established topics: crowd conflict and behaviour in mass emergencies. The second two sections cover topics where social psychology has only recently come together with other disciplines: pedestrian dynamics and mass gatherings. In each case, the social identity approach provides many of the concepts, research questions and hypotheses that have driven novel developments.},

 abstract = {Within the realm of pedestrian research numerous measures have been proposed to estimate the level of crowdedness experienced by pedestrians. However, within the field of pedestrian traffic flow modelling there does not seem to be consensus on the question which of these measures performs best. This paper shows that the shape and scatter within the resulting fundamental diagrams differs a lot depending on the measure of crowdedness used. The main aim of the paper is to establish the advantages and disadvantages of the currently existing measures to quantify crowdedness in order to evaluate which measures provide both accurate and consistent results. The assessment is not only based on the theoretical differences, but also on the qualitative and quantitative differences between the resulting fundamental diagrams computed using the crowdedness measures on one and the same data set. The qualitative and quantitative functioning of the classical Grid-based measure is compared to with the X-T measure, an Exponentially Weighted Distance measure, and a Voronoi-Diagram measure. The consistency of relating these measures for crowdedness to the two macroscopic flow variables velocity and flow, the computational efficiency and the amount of scatter present within the fundamental diagrams produced by the implementation of the different measures are reviewed. It is found that the Voronoi-Diagram and X-T measure are the most efficient and consistent measures for crowdedness.},

 abstract = {In recent years numerous pedestrian simulation tools have been developed that can support crowd managers and government officials in their tasks. New technologies to monitor pedestrian flows are in dire need of models that allow for rapid state-estimation. Many contemporary pedestrian simulation tools model the movements of pedestrians at a microscopic level, which does not provide an exact solution. Macroscopic models capture the fundamental characteristics of the traffic state at a more aggregate level, and generally have a closed form solution which is necessary for rapid state estimation for traffic management purposes. This contribution presents a next step in the calibration and validation of the macroscopic continuum model detailed in Hoogendoorn et al. (2014).  The influence of global and local route choice on the development of crowd movement phenomena, such as dissipation, lane-formation and stripe-formation, is studied. This study shows that most self-organization phenomena and behavioural trends only develop under very specific conditions, and as such can only be simulated using specific parameter sets. Moreover, all crowd movement phenomena can be reproduced by means of the continuum model using one parameter set. This study concludes that the incorporation of local route choice behaviour and the balancing of the aptitude of pedestrians with respect to their own class and other classes are both essential in the correct prediction of crowd movement dynamics.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an experimental study on pedestrian bidirectional streams and the mechanisms leading to spontaneous lane formation by examining the flow formed by two groups of people walking toward each other in a mock corridor. Flow ratio is changed by changing each group size while maintaining comparable total flow and density. By tracking the trajectories of each pedestrian and analyzing the data obtained, five different phases were recognized as contributing to the transition from unidirectional to bidirectional flow including the spontaneous creation and dissolution of lanes. It has been shown that a statistical treatment is required to understand the fundamental characteristics of pedestrian dynamics and some two-dimensional quantities such as order parameter and rotation range were introduced to allow a more complete analysis. All the quantities observed showed a clear relationship with flow ratio and helped distinguishing between the different characteristic phases of the experiment. Results show that balanced bidirectional flow becomes the most stable configuration after lanes are formed, but the lane creation process requires pedestrians to laterally move to a largest extent compared to low flow-ratio configurations. This finding allows us to understand the reasons why balanced bidirectional flow is efficient at low densities, but quickly leads to deadlock formation at high densities.},

  abstract = {An appropriate and safe behavior for exiting a facility is key to reducing injuries and increasing survival when facing an emergency evacuation in a building. Knowledge on the best evacuation practice is commonly delivered by traditional training approaches such as videos, posters, or evacuation drills, but they may become ineffective in terms of knowledge acquisition and retention. Serious games (SGs) are an innovative approach devoted to training and educating people in a gaming environment. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to immersive virtual reality (IVR)-based SGs for evacuation knowledge delivery and behavior assessment because they are highly engaging and promote greater cognitive learning. This paper aims to understand the development and implementation of IVR SGs in the context of building evacuation training and research, applied to various indoor emergencies such as fire and earthquake. Thus, a conceptual framework for effective design and implementation through the systematic literature review method was developed. As a result, this framework integrates critical aspects and provides connections between them, including pedagogical and behavioral impacts, gaming environment development, and outcome and participation experience measures.},

 abstract = {Everybody would agree that vision guides locomotion; but how does vision influence choice when there are different solutions for possible foot placement? We addressed this question by investigating the impact of perceptual grouping on foot placement in humans. Participants performed a stepping stone task in which pathways consisted of target stones in a spatially regular path of foot falls and visual distractor stones in their proximity. Target and distractor stones differed in shape and colour so that each subset of stones could be easily grouped perceptually. In half of the trials, one target stone swapped shape and colour with a distractor in its close proximity. We show that in these {\textquoteleft}swapped{\textquoteright} conditions, participants chose the perceptually groupable, instead of the spatially regular, stepping location in over 40\% of trials, even if the distance between perceptually groupable steps was substantially larger than normal step width/length. This reveals that the existence of a pathway that could be traversed without spatial disruption to periodic stepping is not sufficient to guarantee participants will select it and suggests competition between different types of visual input when choosing foot placement. We propose that a bias in foot placement choice in favour of visual grouping exists as, in nature, sudden changes in visual characteristics of the ground increase the uncertainty for stability.},

 abstract = {A network, in which two integers tij (the traversal time) and cij (the capacity) are associated with each arc PiPj, is considered with respect to the following question. What is the maximal amount of goods that can be transported from one node to another in a given number T of time periods, and how does one ship in order to achieve this maximum? A computationally efficient algorithm for solving this dynamic linear-programming problem is presented. The algorithm has the following features (a) The only arithmetic operations required are addition and subtraction (b) In solving for a given time period T, optimal solutions for all lesser time periods are a by-product (c) The constructed optimal solution for a given T is presented as a relatively small number of activities (chain-flows) which are repeated over and over until the end of the T periods. Hence, in particular, hold-overs at intermediate nodes are not required (d) Arcs which serve as bottlenecks for the flow are singled out, as well as the time periods in which they act as such (e) In solving the problem for successive values of T, stabilization on a set of chain-flows (see (c) above) eventually occurs, and an a priori bound on when stabilization occurs can be established. The fact that there exist solutions to this problem which have the simple form described in (c) is remarkable, since other dynamic linear-programming problems that have been studied do not enjoy this property.},

We show that placing an obstacle does not guarantee, by itself, better chances of survival for all pedestrians. The way they choose to avoid the obstacle is critical for their own performance. We found not only that the faster they try to escape, the slower they get out ("faster is slower" effect), but also, the short cut they might take in order to get to the exit will probably do no better ("clever is not always better" effect).},

Major crowd incidents are described. Extreme crowding results in individual loss of control, and both psychological and physiological problems. A simple model with the acronym "FIST" is proposed to provide a basic understanding of crowd disasters. The acronym elements are defined as the crowd Force (F); the Information (I) upon which the crowd acts; the physical Space (S) involved, both in terms of individual density and larger scale architectural features; and Time (T), the duration of the incident. The model is used to illustrate crowd characteristics and to develop guidelines for the prevention of crowd disasters. It is concluded that real time information and communication are key factors in preventing crowd disasters. The formal certification of crowd manager for venues of 500 persons or more is recommended.},

Their stepping features such as speed, step length, step time and step width were obtained according to trajectory extraction and curvature calculation. Relations between these variables during ascending and descending movement on stairs are analyzed and compared. The effects of group sizes and movement processes on stepping locomotion are also discussed. It is discovered that both step time and step width for groups with larger size are significantly higher during descending movement.

 abstract = {This study investigates motion in a crowd of pedestrians walking at different speeds. Three pedestrian groups are considered (slow walkers, normal walkers, and fast walkers), and we design the experimental condition by mixing the normal walkers with either the slow or the fast walkers to create flows with different speed compositions. All the walkers in this experiment were instructed to walk along a circular course unidirectionally. Fundamental diagrams and multiple regression analysis show that the speed at which a particular pedestrian walks is determined by both the local density and the speed at which the surrounding pedestrians are walking. We also find that the spontaneous lane formation, that occurs in bidirectional flow, does not occur in flow in which the speed is heterogeneous, thereby resulting in a spatial density distribution with large variance. This corresponds to pedestrian clustering, which reduces both the mean speed and the flow rate.},

A range of evacuation scenarios is explored in order to better understand the evacuation of the WTC on 11 September 2001. The analysis makes use of response time data derived from a study of published WTC survivor accounts. Geometric details of the building are obtained from architects' plans while the total building population used in the scenarios is based on estimates produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology formal investigation into the evacuation. This paper attempts to approximate the events of 11 September 2001 and pursue several `what if' questions concerning the evacuation. In particular, the study explores the likely outcome had a single staircase survived intact from top to bottom. More generally, this paper explores issues associated with the practical limits of building size that can be expected to be efficiently evacuated using stairs alone.},

 abstract = {Pedestrian crowds can form the substrate of important socially contagious behaviors, including propagation of visual attention, violence, opinions, and emotional state. However, relating individual to collective behavior is often difficult, and quantitative studies have largely used laboratory experimentation. We present two studies in which we tracked the motion and head direction of 3,325 pedestrians in natural crowds to quantify the extent, influence, and context dependence of socially transmitted visual attention. In our first study, we instructed stimulus groups of confederates within a crowd to gaze up to a single point atop of a building. Analysis of passersby shows that visual attention spreads unevenly in space and that the probability of pedestrians adopting this behavior increases as a function of stimulus group size before saturating for larger groups. We develop a model that predicts that this gaze response will lead to the transfer of visual attention between crowd members, but it is not sufficiently strong to produce a tipping point or critical mass of gaze-following that has previously been predicted for crowd dynamics. A second experiment, in which passersby were presented with two stimulus confederates performing suspicious/irregular activity, supports the predictions of our model. This experiment reveals that visual interactions between pedestrians occur primarily within a 2-m range and that gaze-copying, although relatively weak, can facilitate response to relevant stimuli. Although the above aspects of gaze-following response are reproduced robustly between experimental setups, the overall tendency to respond to a stimulus is dependent on spatial features, social context, and sex of the passerby.},

 abstract = {Schooling, an archetype of collective behaviour, emerges from the interactions of fish responding to sensory information mediated by their aqueous environment. A fundamental and largely unexplored question in fish schooling concerns the role of hydrodynamics. Here, we investigate this question by modelling swimmers as vortex dipoles whose interactions are governed by the Biot-Savart law. When we enhance these dipoles with behavioural rules from classical agent-based models, we find that they do not lead robustly to schooling because of flow-mediated interactions. We therefore propose to use swimmers equipped with adaptive decision-making that adjust their gaits through a reinforcement learning algorithm in response to nonlinearly varying hydrodynamic loads. We demonstrate that these swimmers can maintain their relative position within a formation by adapting their strength and school in a variety of prescribed geometrical arrangements. Furthermore, we identify schooling patterns that minimize the individual and collective swimming effort, through an evolutionary optimization. The present work suggests that the adaptive response of individual swimmers to flow-mediated interactions is critical in fish schooling.},

 abstract = {Human visual object recognition is typically rapid and seemingly effortless, as well as largely independent of viewpoint and object orientation. Until very recently, animate visual systems were the only ones capable of this remarkable computational feat. This has changed with the rise of a class of computer vision algorithms called deep neural networks (DNNs) that achieve human-level classification performance on object recognition tasks. Furthermore, a growing number of studies report similarities in the way DNNs and the human visual system process objects, suggesting that current DNNs may be good models of human visual object recognition. Yet there clearly exist important architectural and processing differences between state-of-the-art DNNs and the primate visual system. The potential behavioural consequences of these differences are not well understood. We aim to address this issue by comparing human and DNN generalisation abilities towards image degradations. We find the human visual system to be more robust to image manipulations like contrast reduction, additive noise or novel eidolon-distortions. In addition, we find progressively diverging classification error-patterns between humans and DNNs when the signal gets weaker, indicating that there may still be marked differences in the way humans and current DNNs perform visual object recognition. We envision that our findings as well as our carefully measured and freely available behavioural datasets provide a new useful benchmark for the computer vision community to improve the robustness of DNNs and a motivation for neuroscientists to search for mechanisms in the brain that could facilitate this robustness.},

@article{geraerts-2007-cdyn,
 abstract = {In many virtual environment applications, paths have to be planned for characters to traverse from a start to a goal position in the virtual world while avoiding obstacles. Contemporary applications require a path planner that is fast (to ensure real-time interaction with the environment) and flexible (to avoid local hazards such as small and dynamic obstacles). In addition, paths need to be smooth and short to ensure natural looking motions. Current path planning techniques do not obey these criteria simultaneously. For example, A* approaches generate unnatural looking paths, potential field-based methods are too slow, and sampling-based path planning techniques are inflexible. We propose a new technique, the Corridor Map Method (CMM), which satisfies all the criteria. In an off-line construction phase, the CMM creates a system of collision-free corridors for the static obstacles in an environment. In the query phase, paths can be planned inside the corridors for different types of characters while avoiding dynamic obstacles. Experiments show that high-quality paths for single characters or groups of characters can be obtained in real-time.},

To obtain a useful prediction, the input parameters must be chosen carefully. In many cases, a lack of knowledge or limited measurement accuracy add uncertainty to the input. In addition, for meaningful parameter studies, we first need to identify the most influential parameters of our parametric computer models. The field of uncertainty quantification offers standardized and fully automatized methods that we believe to be beneficial for pedestrian dynamics. In addition, many methods come at a comparatively low cost, even for computationally expensive problems. This allows for their application to larger scenarios. We aim to identify and adapt fitting methods to microscopic crowd simulation in order to explore their potential in pedestrian dynamics. In this work, we first perform a variance-based sensitivity analysis using Sobol' indices and then crosscheck the results by a derivative-based measure, the activity scores. We apply both methods to a typical scenario in crowd simulation, a bottleneck. Because constrictions can lead to high crowd densities and delays in evacuations, several experiments and simulation studies have been conducted for this setting. We show qualitative agreement between the results of both methods. Additionally, we identify a one-dimensional subspace in the input parameter space and discuss its impact on the simulation. Moreover, we analyze and interpret the sensitivity indices with respect to the bottleneck scenario.},

@article{graat-1999-cdyn,
 abstract = {This paper is concerned with the concept of building evacuation and the factors that affect the emergency egress time. It argues that the total evacuation time can be divided into three components: the time to recognize a dangerous situation, the time to decide for evacuation and the time for the movement towards safety. The last component, the egress time, is studied closely in this paper. When the capacity of a walkway is known, this component can be calculated. The capacity however is affected by a number of factors. Through two field studies the effects of the motivation of people to move and the slope of stairs on capacity have been tested. It appears that initially motivation has an accelerating effect, but as the number of people per square meter grows their speed decreases. Also the steeper the slope of stairs, the slower people will move on them. Furthermore the value for capacity used in design and egress time calculations is looked upon. Various researchers have come up with different values. Some recommend the use of the maximum value, which gives the minimum egress time, while others recommend the use of a mean value for capacity, which gives a mean value for egress time. This paper discusses the advantages of the use of a mean value over the use of a maximum value, and thus of the use of an average over a minimum egress time.},

 abstract = {We consider a microscopic model (a system of self-propelled particles) to study the behaviour of a large group of pedestrians walking in a corridor. Our point of interest is the effect of anisotropic interactions on the global behaviour of the crowd. The anisotropy we have in mind reflects the fact that people do not perceive (i.e. see, hear, feel or smell) their environment equally well in all directions. The dynamics of the individuals in our model follow from a system of Newton-like equations in the overdamped limit. The instantaneous velocity is modelled in such a way that it accounts for the angle at which an individual perceives another individual. We investigate the effects of this perception anisotropy by means of simulations, very much in the spirit of molecular dynamics. We define a number of characteristic quantifiers (including the polarization index and Morisita index) that serve as measures, for example, for organization and clustering, and we use these indices to investigate the influence of anisotropy on the global behaviour of the crowd. The goal of the paper is to investigate the potential of this model; extensive statistical analysis of simulation data and reproducing any specific real-life situation are beyond its scope.},

@article{hackney-2015-cdyn,
 abstract = {The current study set out to evaluate how individuals walk through apertures created by different stationary obstacles. Specifically, we examined whether the passability of apertures differed between human and pole obstacles by quantifying aperture crossing behaviors such as the critical point. Participants walked an 8m path toward a visible goal located at the end. Two obstacles were positioned 5m from the starting location and participants were instructed to pass between the obstacles without hitting them. The distance between the obstacles ranged between 1.0 and 1.8x the participant's shoulder width. Results revealed that, when the obstacles were humans, individuals rotated their shoulders more frequently at larger apertures, as evidenced by a larger critical point (1.7 vs 1.3 for poles), initiated shoulder rotations earlier, rotated to a larger degree, left a wider clearance between their shoulders and the obstacles at the time of crossing, and walked slower when approaching and passing through the obstacles compared to when the obstacles were poles. Furthermore, correlational analyses revealed that the amount of change between an individual's critical point for the poles and the critical point for the human obstacles was related to social risk-taking and changes in walking speed. Therefore, it appears that the passability of apertures changes when walking between two people versus two objects such that more space and greater caution are needed for human obstacles. It is possible that the greater caution observed for human obstacles is to account for the personal space needs of others that do not exist in the same extent for poles and that the degree of caution is related to social factors.},

 abstract = {We present a framework for estimating pedestrian demand within a train station. It takes into account ridership data, and various direct and indirect indicators of demand. Such indicators may include link flow counts, density measurements, survey data, historical, or other information. The problem is considered in discrete time and at the aggregate level, i.e., for groups of pedestrians associated with the same origin-destination pair and departure time interval. The formulation is probabilistic, allowing to consider the stochasticity of demand. A key element is the use of the train timetable, and in particular of train arrival times, to capture demand peaks. A case study analysis of a Swiss train station underlines the practical applicability of the proposed framework. Compared to a classical estimator that ignores the notion of a train timetable, the gain in accuracy in terms of root-mean-square error is between 20\% and 50\%. More importantly, the incorporation of the train schedule allows for prediction when little or no data besides the timetable and ridership information is available.

 abstract = {Introduction
The safety of humans in crowded environments has been recognised as an important and rapidly growing research area with significant implications for urban planning, event management, building design, fire safety engineering and rescue service to name a few. This stream of research is aimed at guiding safe designs and effective evacuation plans by simulating emergency scenarios and estimating measures such as total evacuation time. A large body of research has also been dedicated to the development of modelling tools with the capability to identify (and thus prevent) circumstances that lead to crowd discomfort, crashes or disasters in mass gatherings and public facilities. It has, however, been argued that the empirical knowledge in this area has lagged behind the theoretical developments and computational capabilities. This has left the descriptive power of the existing models for reproducing the natural behaviour of humans questionable given that in many cases there is a lack of reliable and well-conditioned data for model validation or calibration purposes.
Methods
With the vast majority of the empirical knowledge in this fast-growing and interdisciplinary field being very recent, a survey of the existing literature is still missing. Here, we gather together the existing empirical knowledge in this area in a comprehensive review (based on surveying more than 160 studies restricted to those published in peer-reviewed journals since 1995) in order to help bridge this gap. We introduce for the first time a categorisation system of the relevant data collection techniques by recognising seven general empirical approaches. We also differentiate between various aspects of human behaviour pertinent to crowd behaviour by putting them into perspective in terms of three general levels of decision making. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages offered by each data collection technique. Major gaps and poorly-explored topics in the current literature are discussed.
Findings and applications
Our major conclusion is that the empirical evidence in this area is largely disperse and even in some cases mixed and contradictory, requiring a more unified system of terminologies and problem definitions as well as unified measurement methods in order for the findings of different studies to become replicable and comparable. We also showed that the existing body of empirical studies display a clear imbalance in addressing various aspects of human behaviour with certain (but crucial) aspects (such as pre-movement time and choice of activity) being poorly understood (as opposed to our knowledge and amount of data about walking behaviour for example). Our review also revealed that previous studies have predominantly displayed a stronger tendency to study the behaviour based on aggregate measures as opposed to individual-level data collection attempts. We hope that this collection of findings sets clearer avenues for advancing the knowledge in this area, guides future experiment designs and helps researchers form better-informed hypotheses and choose most suitable data collection methods for their question in hand.},

  doi           = {10.1177/0361198118796351},
  abstract      = {The increasing occurrence of safety-related incidents like fire and terror attacks in crowded public facilities and mass gatherings has heightened the importance of planning for efficient evacuations through optimizing evacuation routes and architectural designs. This calls for the development of simulation and analytical tools that can replicate occupants' responses and thereby their most likely movement patterns. Such models must be accurate to prevent inappropriate design and planning. One major factor connected to prediction accuracy is the sensitivity of modeling outputs to the value of their various parameters. We report on implementation of a calibrated model of directional choices in a microscopic simulation model of pedestrians' evacuation. We show how estimates of the aggregate measures of prediction are sensitive to the parameters of this tactical level (i.e., directional choice) model. Results demonstrate that the prediction of the total evacuation time and average individual evacuation times are closely correlated with one another in terms of their variation, and are both very sensitive to the specification of each directional choice parameter. Simulated evacuation time could vary up to nearly 30 Percent depending on parameter values. The observed sensitivity highlighted the significance of importing well-calibrated parameters into such simulation models and practicing consistent degrees of accuracy for all levels of decision modeling. We also inferred that the two aggregate measures (i.e., total evacuation time and average individual evacuation times) can be used interchangeably as the basis for evacuation optimization or sensitivity analysis practices.

The design of efficient evacuation plans and accessing accurate estimates of evacuation times have become major concerns related to the safety of crowded public facilities, high-rise buildings, and mass gatherings (1, 2). Attention to this problem has heightened as a result of the increasing occurrence of emergency incidents in such environments within recent years (3). Research on this problem has grown at a fast pace aiming at developing simulation and optimization tools for supporting fast discharge of occupants (4, 5). Such simulation models are meant to allow planners to evaluate the efficiency of their evacuation plans and the architectural design of facilities, perform reliable risk analysis, and identify problematic locations and critical crowding levels.

The accuracy of such models has always been a major issue given the potential ramifications of inappropriate design or poor planning in this context. Clearly, the accuracy of such models relies heavily on how accurately they replicate the element of human behavior. This has particularly been a significant modeling aspect for the microscopic simulation models that attempt to replicate evacuation patterns by simulating individuals' behavior (as happens in reality) (6).

The paucity of data and observations in this particular context has been regarded as a major obstacle towards calibrating and validating many of the existing methodologies and heuristic approaches (7, 8). To address this challenge, one has to resort either to the available field observations from previous emergency incidents (e.g., from CCTV footage) or to collect data in experimental settings. Both approaches, however, pose their own challenges.

While observations from naturally-occurring emergencies are valued for their realism (9, 10), they are rarely accessible to researchers or do not provide sufficient material for modeling or model calibration. Such observations are often one-off and do not offer replications, and the analyst does not have any influence on the observations and thus cannot manipulate any factor for a systematic analysis of a specific phenomenon. They also may be subject to high levels of measurement error (e.g., due to low quality or limited coverage of recorded images).

On the other hand, experimental data provides greater flexibility in that the analyst is in charge of all control factors and can vary them through efficient designs and observe the behavior systematically (11-15). Measurement errors can be kept to a minimum level, and the analyst can replicate the experiments multiple times and draw robust inferences. The major issue is how realistically the context of an experiment can represent a case of an emergency (16). There are certainly limits to how realistic an experiment of evacuation behavior could be, given the ethical and safety restrictions.

A number of authors in this field have suggested that the aspects of the human behavior that need to be investigated and modeled could be classified into three levels of decision making (17-20): (a) occupants' reaction times and pre-evacuation activities, known as "strategic" decisions, (b) their directional route choices, known as "tactical" decisions, and (c) their momentary step choices to avoid collision, known as "operational" decisions. It is clear that accurate modeling in this context necessitates consistent modeling accuracy at all three levels.

In a recent review of the empirical studies in this field, Haghani and Sarvi (21) quantitatively showed that studies related to operational (also known as "walking behavior") models greatly outnumber studies that have addressed the two other aspects of evacuation modeling. Well-functioning and data-supported walking models have been proposed that can adequately replicate the step choices of evacuees (given their directional preferences) (22-24). How occupants make their directional choices has been much less understood, however (25-27). A number of studies have resorted to pure theoretical or modeler-defined assumptions for this aspect (28-31). In the absence of empirical observations, however, one may question the accuracy of such assumptions which could often be quite arbitrary. This could be partly attributed to the greater challenges involved in experimenting with the strategic and tactical levels of decision making as opposed to observing and analyzing pedestrians' walking.

In a recent literature survey, Haghani and Sarvi (21) reviewed the possible relevant data collection methods in this context and identified seven major empirical methods in their categorization: (1) animal crowd experiments (32, 33), (2) virtual reality experiments, (3) controlled laboratory experiments with human crowds, (4) evacuation drills in real buildings, (5) video analysis of naturally-occurring emergencies, (6) video analysis of natural walking, and (7) interview surveys with survivors of mass emergencies. They discussed the advantages and disadvantages offered by each class of data collection and also determined that each class only provides data for particular levels of escape decision making that we categorized earlier.

For the particular problem of directional choices, laboratory experiments with human crowds (34), virtual reality experiments (27, 35), and evacuation drills (36) have proven most popular in former studies. Experiments with human crowds in artificial environments, in particular, have been regarded as a reasonable compromise between the level of contextual realism and the level of controllability. Despite the great efforts that have been made in recent studies, a missing element has been experimental design and analysis at the level of individuals, as previous studies have predominantly been based on the analysis of aggregate (or macroscopic) measures of behavior (26, 37, 38). Although useful insight can still be inferred from such aggregate measures, this common feature of the past studies has partly hindered the derivation of behavioral models suitable for microscopic simulation models.

In this study, we report on a series of controlled laboratory experiments with human crowds dedicated to wayfinding and directional choice behavior. The experimental observations have been extracted at disaggregate (i.e., individual) level from which we derived a multi-variable model of directional choices. The model probabilistically replicates the directional choices by quantifying evacuees' tradeoffs between a number of factors related to the physical architecture of the escape environment (i.e., physical factors) and a number of factors related to peer influence (i.e., social factors). This tactical level model is then integrated with a conventional operational level model of walking to form a bi-layer simulation model of evacuation. We report on sensitivity analyses on the directional choice parameters of this model to examine the sensitivity of system-wise aggregate measures (e.g., total evacuation times) to these calibration parameters.},

  abstract = {The possible presence of social groups amongst occupants in indoor 
evacuation scenarios and the potential discrepancies between their behaviour and that 
of single individuals have been acknowledged in the evacuation dynamics literature. 
Yet, empirical studies on the behavioural characteristics of social-group evacuees, 
particularly those related to their decision-making mechanism, are relatively underrepresented. 
This study reports on a lab-in-the-field experiment of evacuations that investigates the effect 
of group size and stress level on multiple aspects of groups' behaviour. 
These aspects include pre-movement time, decision time (i.e. time taken to reach a directional 
exit decision), exit-choice behaviour, exit-choice changing and intra-group decision dynamics. 
Our main findings showed that:
(I)Group size had a significant effect on pre-movement times 
and decision times (and to lesser extent, on evacuation times). 
People took longer to initiate their movement or to make a directional exit decision 
when in groups compared to when acting alone. The influence of group size on pre-movement 
and decision times, however, was not monotonic. For smaller group sizes (sizes 2 and 3), 
pre-movement and decision times increased with the group size. But for the larger 
group size (size 4), the effect was reversed.(II)The exit-choice mechanism of groups, 
overall, showed a great degree of similarity to that of single individuals. 
This suggests that, from a modelling perspective, the directional exit choices of groups 
could be approximated with the models obtained from datasets of individually-made choices.
(III)Groups were more likely to revisit and change their initial exit decisions under 
the higher level of stress. In addition, social influence was a major factor in triggering 
changes in the exit choices of groups. Nearly 50 percent of the changes in group decisions 
occurred shortly after another neighbour group changed its exit decision. 
In other words, instances of group decision-changing was often followed by another group 
taking a similar action.(IV)As to the within-group dynamics of decision-making, 
our analyses suggested that, regardless of the group size, leadership was the dominant 
group decision-making mechanism (compared to the consensus or the conform-to-majority mechanisms). 
In nearly 50 percent of the cases, group decisions were made by one individual 
taking the lead and hinting the direction of the movement to other members of the group.},

 abstract = {The role of data-driven approaches in studies of crowd behaviour has received an unprecedented recognition in
recent years. As a result, the size of the empirical crowd dynamics literature has rapidly grown and has more than
doubled within only the last two years. This paper comprehensively reviews experimental studies of pedestrian
dynamics published between April 2017 and July 2019. The aim is to capture the unprecedented growth of the
experimental literature, analyse the ways in which the research landscape is changing and identify the emerging
topics. Laboratory crowd experiments were found the most popular among all empirical methods, covering the
most diverse range of topics and constituting nearly half of the empirical literature. The use of animal/insect
crowd experiments, on the other hand, appears to be on the decline. Virtual-reality and evacuation-drill studies
have maintained their popularity. Pedestrian flow at bottlenecks, walking behaviour and route choice persist to
be the top conventional topics. However, new research themes have emerged or have notably gained heightened
momentum. This includes the evacuation of vulnerable groups (i.e. elderly, children, mobility impaired), vertical
evacuation, evacuation under limited visibility, social groups and evacuation training/education. While the top
conventional topics are predominantly explored through laboratory crowd experiments, the methods of evacuation
drills and virtual reality are proving more instrumental in studying the top emerging topics. This highlights
the complementary relation of various experimental approaches in this field. More work seems to be needed
to establish the transferability of experimental findings across methods, geometric layouts, contexts and demographics.},

The method of collecting field observations in natural settings is identified to be gaining increasing traction among other field methods (compared to the years preceding 2017) which in part reflects the recent growing attention to the calibration and validation of simulation models. Also, by assembling and analysing the entire body of empirical crowd literature from 1995 to 2019, this review identifies a list of controversial topics and puts a spotlight on recent experiments that have revisited and, in cases, challenged/modified certain long-held assumptions in crowd dynamics. Nine major controversial topics of crowd dynamics are identified for which mixed or contradictory empirical evidence exist. This includes questions related to the flow of pedestrians through bottlenecks (i.e. the faster-is-slower effect, partial obstruction effect, exit location effect, the nature of exit width-capacity relationship), as well as the decision-making aspects of pedestrian evacuations (i.e. the symmetry breaking phenomenon, and the effect of urgency level on various aspects of decision-making) and other topics such as the effect of social groups on evacuation efficiency or the effect of additional exits on blind evacuation efficiency. It is hoped that the discussions on these topics pave the way for further investigating and explaining these inconsistencies and settling the questions surrounding them.},

These methods update floor fields continuously taking other pedestrians into account. This implies that computational times are mainly determined by the cal- culation of floor fields. In this work, we propose a new computational approach for the construction of dynamic floor fields. The approach is based on the one hand on adaptive grid concepts and on the other hand on a directed calculation of floor fields, i.e. the calculation is restricted to the domain of interest. Combining both techniques the computational complexity can be reduced by a factor of 10 as demonstrated by several realistic scenarios. Thus on-line simulations are possible for moderate realistic scenarios.},

We use an 'active walker' model that takes into account pedestrian motion and orientation and the concomitant feedbacks with the surrounding environment. Such models have previously been applied to the study of complex structure formation in physical, chemical and biological systems. We find that our model is able to reproduce many of the observed large-scale spatial features of trail systems.},

 abstract = {Collective motion, where large numbers of individuals move synchronously together, is achieved when individuals adopt interaction rules that determine how they respond to their neighbors' movements and positions. These rules determine how group-living animals move, make decisions, and transmit information between individuals. Nonetheless, few studies have explicitly determined these interaction rules in moving groups, and very little is known about the interaction rules of fish. Here, we identify three key rules for the social interactions of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki): (i) Attraction forces are important in maintaining group cohesion, while we find only weak evidence that fish align with their neighbor's orientation; (ii) repulsion is mediated principally by changes in speed; (iii) although the positions and directions of all shoal members are highly correlated, individuals only respond to their single nearest neighbor. The last two of these rules are different from the classical models of collective animal motion, raising new questions about how fish and other animals self-organize on the move.},

To gain an understanding of passenger perceptions and tolerance of railway crowding and the impact of passenger behaviour on the crowding experience, qualitative (Stage 1) and quantitative (Stage 2) fieldwork was undertaken between 2009 and 2010 across the five metropolitan railways in Australia. Some results from Stage 1, a two-part qualitative study are given. This involved ethnographic participant observations on trains in five States and 20 focus groups with a total of 179 Australian rail passengers. Focus group participants discussed their reactions to being in close proximity to others in a closed environment and these are examined. This paper will explore the ways in which passengers experience, tolerate and construct perceptions of crowdedness through both avoidance techniques and interactions with fellow passengers.},

We conducted an empirical study with human subjects in a complex multi-level building and compared thinking aloud protocols and performance measures of experienced and inexperienced participants in different wayfinding tasks. Three specific strategies for navigation in multi-level buildings were compared. The central point strategy relies on well-known parts of the building; the direction strategy relies on routes that first head towards the horizontal position of the goal, while the floor strategy relies on routes that first head towards the vertical position of the goal. We show that the floor strategy was preferred by experienced participants over the other strategies and was overall tied to better wayfinding performance. Route knowledge showed a greater impact on wayfinding performance compared to survey knowledge. A cognitive-architectural analysis of the building revealed seven possible c auses for navigation problems. Especially the previous termstaircasenext term design was identified as a major wayfinding obstacle. Finally we address the benefits of cognitive approaches for the architectural design process and describe some open issues for further research.},

Work time was on the average 22 min with individual components of work tasks lasting 2 to 4 min. The mean oxygen consumption for the whole exercise (22 min) was 2.75 +- 0.29 l/min. The most demanding work task demanded an oxygen uptake of 3.55 +- 0.27 l/min. Corresponding values for respiratory minute volumes were 82 +- 14 and 102 +-14 l/min, respectively. Heart rates averaged 168 +- 12 for the whole test and 179 +-13 beats/min for the heaviest work task.

To this end, a generic approach is proposed that enables parameter identification for microscopic models in general and in particular for walker models. The application results provide new insight into the behavior of individual pedestrians, inter-pedestrian differences, as well as the resulting pedestrian flow characteristics. By comparing different models of increasing complexity, it is investigated which of the model amendments are significant from a statistical point of view and which are not. It is shown that besides anisotropy, finite reaction times play an important role in correctly describing microscopic walking behavior. The implications of these findings in the microscopic description of pedestrians flows are considered by studying the predicted flow operations at a narrow bottleneck. It turns out that the finite reaction times have a significant effect on the pedestrian flow operations.},

Numerous studies have attempted to extend FFCA, such that it would consider intelligent tactical-level behaviors such as route and destination choice. This study aims to incorporate the long-term congestion anticipation and aversion in the pedestrians choice of destinations and routes into \{FFCA\} models. The first contribution of this study is the innovative time-dependent static field, which is represented by a tim-space network. The steps of the proposed methodology include path prediction, congestion identification, and time-dependent travel cost calculation, all of which are demonstrated with several illustrative examples. The local structure of \{FFCA\} and its high efficiency can be maintained, because the proposed extension of \{FFCA\} is focused on calculating the time-dependent static field. Another contribution of this study is that the key parameters, namely, congestion threshold and percentage of congestion-averse pedestrians, are calibrated with actual data. Finally, the proposed methodology is validated with a numerical example, and the results are satisfactory in terms of departure rate.},

In order to demonstrate our method, we evaluate a social force model by 1,936 trajectories with graded densities in three different scenarios. Three qualitative conclusions are obtained by observing radar charts of the simulation of the unidirectional experiments. All of them are verified by the comparison of the macroscopic parameters. Besides, we find that a model with smaller error in our method always has a better performance at the macroscopic level. At last, the possible quantitative descriptions of the method are discussed. Compared to the evaluations by comparing collective features like fundamental diagram, our method is general, comprehensive and quantitative. The method provides a new possibility to evaluate any continuous pedestrian dynamic model in any scenario with a standard process.},

In this paper two different experimental scenarios, which could be regarded as the phased evacuation and total evacuation respectively, were conducted on stairs in a high-rise building to investigate the evacuation process and pedestrian movement characteristics down stairs. The evacuation processes were recorded by video cameras, and the movement parameters were extracted from the video data. In experimental scenario one and two, the space-time distribution, the speed of participants walking through two adjacent floors and specific flow for participants through different stair landings were analyzed and discussed. Then, the fundamental diagrams for pedestrians in the two different evacuation scenarios were presented followed by the analysis of the influences of merging flow on pedestrian movement. It is found that the longer time intervals between participants occur because of the bottlenecks caused by slow movement individuals in experimental scenario one. In experimental scenario two, it is found that participants who stand in front of the queue accelerate just before the merging with participants coming from upstairs. Moreover, from the analysis of the fundamental diagram, we find that the merging flow influences pedestrians movement down stairs, and the detailed egress facilities and evacuation processes should be taken into account when the functions of SFPE Handbook are used to predict the evacuation variables. It is also found that the speeds of participants from upstairs are reduced by the entry of participants from the corresponding floors during the merging time period.},

We searched for the behaviour patterns of the individual fish, which allow movement of such a school. On the basis of biological facts we constructed a number of behaviour models and tested them with computer simulations against biological reality. Basic assumptions of our simulations are: (1) The motion of a fish is only influenced by the position and orientation of its nearest neighbours. (2) The new velocity and the turning angle of each fish (after a time step) are calculated by probability distributions taking into account random influences. (3) The movement of each model fish is based upon the same behaviour model, i.e. the modelled fish group swims without a leader. The basic behaviour patterns are attraction, repulsion and parallel orientation. Our investigations show that it is very important how a fish mixes the influences of its neighbours. If a fish averages the influences of its neighbours, the model fish group shows the typical characteristics of a real fish school: strong cohesion and high degree of polarization. If a fish only responds to a single neighbour, the model creates a confused fish group.},

A theory about interactive aggravation and mitigation processes (AM model) was evolved. The model illuminates the different views of the police and the demonstrators. It particularly depicts three critical interactive processes, categorising, organising and mutual treatment, the extreme positions of which may be either aggravation (escalating conflicts and leading to riots) or mitigation (de-escalating conflicts and leading to peaceful demonstrations). It is further proposed that contextual factors such as type of demonstration and type of demonstrators significantly influence the way the police react to different types of crowds. The result supports the Elaborated Social Identity Model as proposed by Reicher and colleagues and the AM model is discussed with reference to that tradition.},

These social interactions are often thought to reduce risk from predators, despite a lack of direct evidence. We investigated risk-related selection for collective motion by allowing real predators (bluegill sunfish) to hunt mobile virtual prey. By fusing simulated and real animal behavior, we isolated predator effects while controlling for confounding factors. Prey with a tendency to be attracted toward, and to align direction of travel with, near neighbors tended to form mobile coordinated groups and were rarely attacked. These results demonstrate that collective motion could evolve as a response to predation, without prey being able to detect and respond to predators.},

We found that the application of these verification tests allowed us to make rather significant improvements to our simulation code (PEDFLOW) for approximately half of the recommended tests. In some cases, we added capabilities that did not exist before. In other cases, we found anomalous behaviors and adjusted the existing code to remove these unexplained behaviors. This paper summarizes the work on the verification tests, highlighting the lessons learned and modifications made. We also discuss some modifications we recommend to the NIST verification tests, as well as demonstrate how to make these tests suitable for all pedestrian flow models (not just building fire evacuation).},

Properties of pedestrians walking in line: Fundamental diagrams - Notes

I. INTRODUCTION

- Pedestrians change velocity and direction.
- Experiment was done on circular path.
- Trajectories of pedestrians were reconstructed in three dimensions.
- Instantaneous fundamental diagram = relation between instantaneous velocity of pedestrian and his instantaneous density
-> instantaneous density d = inverse of his spatial headway h, e.g. h = 0.5 m => d = 1 / 0.5 = 2 ped / m
- v(h) -> velocity depends on headway (step length)
-> Two transitions occurred during experiment: at 1.1 m and at 3 m
-> It is a piecewise linear relation.

II. THE EXPERIMENT

- Goal: characterize one-dimensional pedestrian traffic at various densities.
-> Vary density: either use more pedestrians or modify path.
- Setup
* 28 people (20 male, 8 female)
* Path was limited by two walls: one with radius 2 m and one with radius 4.5 m
=> Two trajectories: one at 2.4 m and one at 4.1 m => Distance travelled: 15.08 m and 25.76 m respectively => People either run on inner or outer circle in a line w/o passing each other
* Density varied between 0.31 to 1.86 ped/m
- Experiment was tracked by a VICON MX-40 motion capture system.

III. FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAM

- Key result is fundamental diagram (density vs. velocity graph).
-> High density => low velocity
- Fundamental diagram at global or local scope.
* Global: velocities and densities are averaged over the whole system and whole duration.
* Local: velocities and densities are measured over a finite time period.
- Another fundamental diagram is instantaneous measurement: distance between two pedestrians is interpreted as the inverse of a density.
-> Distance between two pedestrians = 0.5 m => 1 ped / 0.5 m => 2 ped / 1 m
- Calculations:
* Global density p = N [ped] / 2*pi*R [m]
* Local velocity v = x [m] / t_entry - t_exit
-> x is a small fraction of the circle DELTA Phi
* Instantaneous diagram:
-> instantaneous velocity is used -> "spatial headway" (= distance to predecessor) is used => inverse is interpreted as density => These values are averaged over 60 consecutive time frames (complete time: 0.5 s) and produce one data point
- Among different replicas, the dispersion is stronger for lower densities.
-> Reasoning: at lower densities, test person has more choice to vary velocity and different test persons where involved during different replicas.
- Observations from experiments:
* Stop-and-go waves are formed at high densities.
* Velocity does not vanish but rather reaches a limiting value at high densities.

IV. PHASE TRANSITIONS IN THE FOLLOWING BEHAVIOR

- Three "regimes" were detected:
* Free: spatial headway is greater than 3 m (pedestrians walk with their preferred velocity but adaption time for this is at 13.7 s)
* Weakly constrained: between 1.1 and 3 m (velocity is weakly inferred, adaption time is 5.32 s)
* Strongly constrained: below 1.1 (adaption time is 0.74 s)
=> Almost linear behavior in each regime
=> Adaption decreases when spatial headway decreases (because of imminent collisions)
=> Maybe, adaption time depends on culture (French < German; Germans need a lot of space before moving)

V. CONCLUSION

- Fundamental diagram to describe pedestrian movements.
- Three regimes. Crossovers between them is quite sharp.
- Instead of changing velocity continuously, adaption time takes only three discrete values.

 abstract = {In human crowds, interactions among individuals give rise to a variety of self-organized collective motions that help the group to effectively solve the problem of coordination. However, it is still not known exactly how humans adjust their behavior locally, nor what are the direct consequences on the emergent organization. One of the underlying mechanisms of adjusting individual motions is the stepping dynamics. In this paper, we present first quantitative analysis on the stepping behavior in a one-dimensional pedestrian flow studied under controlled laboratory conditions. We find that the step length is proportional to the velocity of the pedestrian, and is directly related to the space available in front of him, while the variations of the step duration are much smaller. This is in contrast with locomotion studies performed on isolated pedestrians and shows that the local density has a direct influence on the stepping characteristics. Furthermore, we study the phenomena of synchronization-walking in lock step-and show its dependence on flow densities. We show that the synchronization of steps is particularly important at high densities, which has direct impact on the studies of optimizing pedestrians' flow in congested situations. However, small synchronization and antisynchronization effects are found also at very low densities, for which no steric constraints exist between successive pedestrians, showing the natural tendency to synchronize according to perceived visual signals.},

Properties of pedestrians walking in line. II. Stepping behavior - Notes

I. INTRODUCTION

- Behavior of a single pedestrian influences the complete group.
- Research question: how do people behave in large densities?
- In real life, two-dimensional problem (pedestrians move longitudinal and angular).
-> Simplification: just use longitudinal movement and use a straight corridor with periodic boundary conditions at start and end.

+----------------------+

| o o o o o o o |
+----------------------+

Start End

- Paper focuses on stepping behavior in one-dimensional experiment.
- Key results:
* Size of steps is directly related to space in front of pedestrian.
* Step frequency is far less sensitive to local density.
* Synchronisation between pedestrians occur in high AND low density situations.
- Idea: motivate synchronisation by using music.

II. EXPERIMENT

- Experiment focuses on stepping behavior in various dynamic regimes, e.g. free flow and jams.
- Setup:
* Circular path
* Inner wall with radius 2 m
* Outer wall with radius 4.5 m
* 28 test persons (20 male, 8 female)
- Observed behavior:
* Two trajectories: one with radius 2.4 m and the other with 4.1 m
* Average global density varied from 0.31 to 1.86 ped / m

III. STEP MEASUREMENTS

- In previous paper, oscillations of trajectories were filtered.
-> Now these oscillations are evaluated, i.e. why are there any oscillations?
- Body of pedestrian sways when walking.
- Information for step length, step duration and synchronisation could be extracted.

IV. STEPPING LAWS

- Different plots:
* instantaneous velocity vs. length of steps
-> It is proportional.
* instantaneous velocity vs. duration of steps
-> It is proportional.
* instantaneous density vs. length of steps
-> Length of steps decreases if density increases.
* instantaneous density vs. duration of steps
-> Duration increases if density increases.
- Immam's law (step length = sqrt(v)) contradicts observations.
- In experiment, pedestrians rather adapt their velocity by changing step length than step frequency.
-> Valid for inner and outer circle => it is independent of geometry.
- Density plots are identical to previous paper.
- Duration of step only varies a little bit around a lower boundary => Too small durations are uncomfortable for pedestrians.

V. STEP SYNCHRONIZATION

- At high densities, pedestrians squeeze front foot into hole made by front foot of predecessor (phenomena is called "lock step").
- Plot radii of pedestrian's trajectory over time:
* Oscillations were observed => shorter and longer paths are walked.
* Pedestrians are synchronised if plots are equal.
* Plots of two pedestrians next to each other are analysed if there plots are almost equal.
-> There is a phase shift.
- It is still an open question to which signals pedestrians are most sensitive.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

- Step length is proportional to velocity.
- Duration of steps only varies very little.
- In contrast to hypothesis, pedestrians use very little steps instead of waiting and making a big one.
- Results differ from experiments with isolated pedestrians.
- At high densities, pedestrians synchronize their steps using "lock step".
- Also at low densities pedestrians tend to synchronize their steps.
- Music improves synchronisation. A simple metronome is worse.
- Further experiments with music and metronome are necessary.

 abstract = {Despite the vast amount of studies on pedestrian flow, the data concerning high densities are still very inadequate. We organize one large-scale pedestrian flow experiment on a ring corridor. With 278 participants, the density as high as 9 m^(-2) is reached. In the uni-directional flow, four different states are observed, including the free flow, congested state, over-congested state and hyper-congested state. The features of the hyper-congested state are similar to the "crowd turbulence" reported in the empirical data of Helbing et al., and the transition between the stopped state and the moving state can be found. The flow rates in the over-congested state are nearly constant, due to the downstream propagation of pedestrian clusters. In the bi-directional flow, three different types of lane formations are observed in the experiment: (1) three lanes are directly formed ; (2) two lanes are directly formed; (3) firstly three lanes are formed, and then they transit into two lanes. After the lane formation, some interesting phenomena have been observed, including the inhomogeneous distribution of pedestrians across the lanes, and the formation and dissipation of localized crowd. Our study is expected to help for better understanding and modeling the dynamics of high density pedestrian flow.},

There is a large variety in flow and speed as functions of density for empirical data of pedestrian streams obtained from studies in different countries. The net-time headway, however, stays approximately constant over all these different data sets. By using this fact, we demonstrate how the underlying dynamics of pedestrian crowds, naturally follows from local interactions. This means that there is no need to come up with an arbitrary fit function (with arbitrary fit parameters) as has traditionally been done. Further, by using not only the average density values but the variance as well, we show how the recently reported stop-and-go waves [ Helbing et al. Phys. Rev.

  abstract  = {This paper provides an overview of the state of the art in evacuation simulations. These interactive computer based tools have been developed to help the owners and designers of large public buildings to assess the risks that occupants might face during emergency egress. The development of the Glasgow Evacuation Simulator is used to illustrate the existing generation of tools. This system uses Monte Carlo techniques to control individual and group movements during an evacuation. The end-user can interactively open and block emergency exits at any point. It is also possible to alter the priorities that individuals associate with particular exit routes. A final benefit is that the tool can derive evacuation simulations directly from existing architects models; this reduces the cost of simulations and creates a more prominent role for these tools in the iterative development of large-scale public buildings. Empirical studies have been used to validate the GES system as a tool to support evacuation training. The development of these tools has been informed by numerous human factors studies and by recent accident investigations. For example, the 2003 fire in the Station nightclub in Rhode Island illustrated the way in which most building occupants retrace their steps to an entrance even when there are alternate fire exits. The second half of this paper uses this introduction to criticise the existing state of the art in evacuation simulations. These criticisms are based on a detailed study of the recent findings from the 9/11 Commission (2004). Ten different lessons are identified. Some relate to the need to better understand the role of building management and security systems in controlling egress from public buildings. Others relate to the human factors involved in coordinating distributed groups of emergency personnel who may be physically exhausted by the demands of an evacuation. Arguably the most important findings centre on the need to model the ingress and egress of emergency personnel from these structures. The previous focus of nearly all-existing simulation tools has been on the evacuation of building occupants rather than on the safety of first responders1.},

 abstract = {Determining individual-level interactions that govern highly coordinated motion in animal groups or cellular aggregates has been a long-standing challenge, central to understanding the mechanisms and evolution of collective behavior. Numerous models have been proposed, many of which display realistic-looking dynamics, but nonetheless rely on untested assumptions about how individuals integrate information to guide movement. Here we infer behavioral rules directly from experimental data. We begin by analyzing trajectories of golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas) swimming in two-fish and three-fish shoals to map the mean effective forces as a function of fish positions and velocities. Speeding and turning responses are dynamically modulated and clearly delineated. Speed regulation is a dominant component of how fish interact, and changes in speed are transmitted to those both behind and ahead. Alignment emerges from attraction and repulsion, and fish tend to copy directional changes made by those ahead. We find no evidence for explicit matching of body orientation. By comparing data from two-fish and three-fish shoals, we challenge the standard assumption, ubiquitous in physics-inspired models of collective behavior, that individual motion results from averaging responses to each neighbor considered separately; three-body interactions make a substantial contribution to fish dynamics. However, pairwise interactions qualitatively capture the correct spatial interaction structure in small groups, and this structure persists in larger groups of 10 and 30 fish. The interactions revealed here may help account for the rapid changes in speed and direction that enable real animal groups to stay cohesive and amplify important social information.},

The pedestrian model used for the forecast is a modification of the centrifugal force model which operates in continuous space. It is combined with an event driven route choice algorithm which encompasses the local shortest path, the global shortest path and a combination with the quickest path. A naive implementation of this model has the complexity of O(N2), N being the number of pedestrians. In the first step of the optimisation the complexity is reduced to O(N) using special neighbourhood lists like Verlet-List or Linked-Cell commonly used in molecular dynamics. The next step in this optimisation process is parallelisation on a multicore system. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) application programming interfaces are used to this extend. The simulation is performed on the Juropa cluster installed at the J{\"u}lich Supercomputing Centre. The speedup factors obtained are {\textasciitilde}10 for the linked-cells, {\textasciitilde}4 for 8 threads and {\textasciitilde}3 for the parallelisation on 5 nodes using a static domain decomposition.},

The aim is to perform real-time forecasts of pedestrian traffic. For this purpose, special neighbourhood lists and a two-stage hybrid parallelisation are used. The second part of this dissertation deals with route choice in complex structures, which plays an important role in achieving realistic computer simulations of pedestrian flows. The developed route choice process is based on visibility and perception of the local environment by the simulated agents. It has as basis a navigation graph. The generation of the graph, especially in complex structures, has also been performed within the framework of this thesis.

  abstract = {Usually, modeling of the evacuations is done during the planning and authorizing process of office buildings or large scale facilities, where computing time is not an issue at all. The collaborative Hermes project aims at improving the safety of mass events by constructing an evacuation assistant, a decision support system for heads of operation in an actual evacuation. For this, the status (occupancy and available egress routes) of a facility is constantly monitored with automatic person counters, door sensors, smoke sensors, and manual input from security staff. Starting from this status, egress is simulated faster than real time, and the result visualized in a suitable fashion to show what is likely to happenn in the next 15min. The test case for this evacuation assistant is the clearing of the ESPRIT Arena in D\"usseldorf which holds 50,000-65,000 persons depending on the event type. The on site prediction requires the ability to simulate the egress in $\approx$2min, a task that requires the combination of a fast algorithm and a parallel computer. The paper will describe the details of the evacuation problem, the architecture of the evacuation assistant, the pedestrian motion model employed and the optimization and parallelization of the code.},

 abstract = {Pedestrian behavior is an omnipresent topic, but the underlying cognitive processes and the various influences on movement behavior are still not fully understood. Nonetheless, computational simulations that predict crowd behavior are essential for safety, economics, and transport. Contemporary approaches of pedestrian behavior modeling focus strongly on the movement aspects and seldom address the rich body of research from cognitive science. Similarly, general purpose cognitive architectures are not suitable for agents that can move in spatial domains because they do not consider the profound findings of pedestrian dynamics research. Thus, multi-agent simulations of crowd behavior that strongly incorporate both research domains have not yet been fully realized. Here, we propose the cognitive agent framework Spice. The framework provides an approach to structure pedestrian agent models by integrating concepts of pedestrian dynamics and cognition. Further, we provide a model that implements the framework. The model solves spatial sequential choice problems in sufficient detail, including movement and cognition aspects. We apply the model in a computer simulation and validate the Spice approach by means of data from an uncontrolled field study. The Spice framework is an important starting point for further research, as we believe that fostering interdisciplinary modeling approaches will be highly beneficial to the field of pedestrian dynamics.},

the social sciences. They are particularly suited to simulating complex systems. Despite many
methodological advances within ABM, one of the major drawbacks is their inability to incorporate
real-time data to make accurate short-term predictions. This paper presents an approach that allows
ABMs to be dynamically optimised. Through a combination of parameter calibration and data
assimilation (DA), the accuracy of model-based predictions using ABM in real time is increased. We
use the exemplar of a bus route system to explore these methods. The bus route ABMs developed in
this research are examples of ABMs that can be dynamically optimised by a combination of parameter
calibration and DA. The proposed model and framework can also be used in an passenger information

 abstract = {Evacuation from a smoke filled tunnel requires quick decision-making and swift action from the tunnel occupants. Technical installations such as emergency signage aim to guide tunnel occupants to the closest emergency exits. However, conflicting information may come from the behavior of other tunnel occupants. We examined if and how conflicting social information may affect evacuation in terms of delayed and/or inadequate evacuation decisions and behaviors. To this end, forty participants were repeatedly situated in a virtual reality smoke filled tunnel with an emergency exit visible to one side of the participants. Four social influence conditions were realized. In the control condition participants were alone in the tunnel, while in the other three experimental conditions a virtual agent (VA) was present. In the no-conflict condition, the VA moved to the emergency exit. In the active conflict condition, the VA moved in the opposite direction of the emergency exit. In the passive conflict condition, the VA stayed passive. Participants were less likely to move to the emergency exit in the conflict conditions compared to the no-conflict condition. Pre-movement and movement times in the passive conflict condition were significantly delayed compared to all other conditions. Participants moved the longest distances in the passive conflict condition. These results support the hypothesis that social influence affects evacuation behavior, especially passive behavior of others can thwart an evacuation to safety.},

Virtual environments provide a maximum of experimental control, are easy to replicate, have relatively high ecological validity, and allow safe study of occupant behavior in scenarios that otherwise would be too dangerous. Lower ecological validity compared to field studies, ergonomic aspects, and technical limitations are the main weaknesses of the method.

Definitions of RP can be broadly divided into expectancy-value and risk-as-feeling approaches. In the present review, RP is seen as the personalization of the risk related to a current event, such as an ongoing fire emergency; it is influenced by emotions and prone to cognitive biases. We differentiate RP from other related concepts (e.g., situation awareness) and introduce theoretical frameworks relevant to RP in fire evacuation (e.g., Protective Action Decision Model and Heuristic-Systematic approaches). Furthermore, we review studies on RP during evacuation with a focus on the World Trade Center evacuation on September 11, 2001 and present factors modulating RP as well as the relation between perceived risk and protective actions. We summarize the factors that influence perception risk and discuss the direction of these relationships (i.e., positive or negative influence, or inconsequential) and conclude with presenting limitations of this review and an outlook on future research.},

 abstract = {Animals living in groups will profit most from sociality if they coordinate the timing and nature of their activities. Self-organizing mechanisms can underlie coordination in large animal groups such as insect colonies or fish schools, but to what degree these mechanisms operate in socially complex species that live in small stable groups is not well known. We therefore examined the collective departure of wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, from their sleeping sites. First, in line with previous observations, the departure process appeared to be coordinated through the cue of individuals 'moving off', with no role for specific vocal or visual signalling. Second, we employed network analyses to explore how interindividual relationships influenced departure patterns, and found that a local rule, to follow the movements of those baboons with whom they shared a close social affiliation, determined when the baboon group departed. Finally, using an agent-based model, we were able to simulate mathematically the observed patterns of collective movements based upon the emergent rule that we identified. Our study adds weight to the idea that social complexity does not necessitate cognitive complexity in the decision-making process, consistent with heuristic decision-making perspectives studied by cognitive psychologists and researchers studying self-organization in biological systems.},

 abstract = {During a fire evacuation, once an individual perceives cues from a fire event, they must interpret them to assess the new situation and determine whether action is required. It is proposed that this assessment and action selection can employ either an automatic or reflective processing system depending on the nature of the situation and the experiences of the individual involved. This decision-making process is bounded in terms of the information available, the time available, and an individual's resources to process such information that influences which processing mechanism is adopted. To compensate for such limitations and manage the uncertainty and complexity associated with the decision-making process, people may employ heuristics that reduce decision-making from a cognitively effortful problem-solving task requiring mental reflection, to a less effortful pattern-matching process, where stored conditions and expectations are quickly scanned to identify relevant responses. During this decision-making process cognitive biases may occur which cause an individual to neglect or be biased towards certain information: this may potentially lead to an inappropriate and/or unexpected response. Cognitive biases affect performance without the individual being directly aware of them. This paper identifies cognitive biases from existing literature that may influence a person's decision-making process during a fire evacuation, along with how these align with general decision-making in the process. The purpose of the article is to promote consideration of cognitive biases in the modeling of evacuee behavior, as well as during the fire safety design of buildings and evacuation procedures.},

Furthermore, the influence of increasing the maximal walking speed v max is investigated by increasing the interaction range beyond nearest neighbour interactions. The extension of the model to v max >1 turns out to be a severe challenge which can be solved in different ways. Four major variants are discussed that take into account different dynamical aspects. The variation of v max has a strong influence on the shape of the flow--density relation. We show that walking speeds v max >1 lead to results which are in very good agreement with empirical data.},

of approaches, with very different characteristics, compete. Often only the experts in one special model type are able to assess the consequences these characteristics have on a simulation study. Therefore, scientists from all disciplines who 
wish to use simulations to analyze pedestrian dynamics need a tool to compare competing approaches. Developers, too, would profit from an easy way to get insight into an alternative modeling ansatz. Vadere meets this interdisciplinary demand

But classic locomotion models fail when collective cooperation is called for, notably when an agent, say a first-aid attendant, needs to forge a path through a densely packed group. We present a controlled experiment to observe what happens when humans pass through a dense static crowd. We formulate and test hypothesis on salient phenomena. We discuss our observations in a psychological framework. We derive a model that incorporates: agents' perception and cognitive processing of a situation that needs cooperation; selection from a portfolio of behaviours, such as being cooperative; and a suitable action, such as swapping places. Agents' ability to successfully get through a dense crowd emerges as an effect of the psychological model.},

movement, e.g., information provided by event organizers and navigation or allocation of other pedestrians. The most
common method for introducing such information into simulations is the application of different floor fields. The
floor fields provide 'local knowledge' that affects pedestrians by modifying of the transition functions of an applied
cellular automaton. The main disadvantage of this method is its time consuming updating process. We propose GPU
based calculation of static and dynamic floor fields, whereby simulations that use several different floor fields can
be efficiently calculated. A single GPU is able to cope with SDM calculations while other GPUs updates dynamic
floor fields constantly or when required. We also present the classic approach to performing CA based simulations on
systems with multiple processing units. The lattice is simply partitioned between the available GPUs. We compare
these two approaches in terms of performance and functionality.},

 abstract = {One of the most important aspects for a realistic prediction of pedestrian flows is the modelling of human navigation in normal situations such as early design phases of buildings or transportation systems and hubs as well as in evacuation studies to enhance safety in existing infrastructures. To overcome the limitations of current navigation models, this paper proposes a new hybrid multi-scale model, which closely links information between the small-scale and large-scale navigation layer to improve the navigational behaviour. In the presented hybrid navigation model, graph-based methods using visibility graphs are used to model large-scale wayfinding decisions. The pedestrians' movements between two nodes of the navigation graph are modelled by means of a dynamic navigation field. The navigation field is updated dynamically during the runtime of the simulation, explicitly considering other pedestrians for determining the fastest path. The proposed hybrid approach provides a realistic modelling of human navigational behaviour and thus a realistic prediction of flows since it reflects the human cognitive processes triggered by wayfinding tasks. This includes taking into account other pedestrians for routing decisions who are visible from the current position of the considered pedestrian. The paper discusses the concept and the technical details of the proposed hybrid multi-scale approach in detail and presents an extensive case study demonstrating its advantages.},

 abstract = {Although various theories have been adopted to develop reliable pedestrian walking models, a limited effort has been made to calibrate them rigorously based on individual trajectories. Most researchers have validated their models by comparing observed and estimated traffic flow parameters such as speed, density, and flow rate, or replaced the validation by visual confirmation of some well-known phenomena such as channelization and platooning. The present study adopted maximum likelihood estimation to calibrate a social-force model based on the observed walking trajectories of pedestrians. The model was assumed to be made up of five components (i.e., inertia, desired direction, leader--follower relationship, collision avoidance, and random error), and their corresponding coefficients represented relative sensitivity. The model also included coefficients for individual-specific characteristics and for a distance-decay relationship between a pedestrian and his/her leaders or colliders. The calibration results varied with the two density levels adopted in the present study. In the case of high density, significant coefficient estimates were found with respect to both the leader--follower relationship and collision avoidance. Collision avoidance did not affect the pedestrian's walking behavior for the low-density case due to channelization. The distance limit was confirmed, within which a pedestrian is affected by neighbors. At the low-density level, by comparison with women, men were found to more actively follow leaders, and pedestrians walking in a party were found to be less sensitive to the motion of leaders at the high-density level.},

Agents joining a society or accepting a contract for the purpose of executing specific collaborative tasks usually have to adopt norms representing certain rules and regulations. Adoption of norms can cause problems -- an agent maybe already hold norms that would be in conflict or inconsistent with new norms it adopts. How can it be shown that the set of norms is consistent to allow the agent to act according to the ideals that the norms specify? In general, the answer to such a question in a real-world situation is not simple.

 abstract = {The most important objective of a fire safety design is to ensure that humans can safely escape from a building in the case of fire. Fire regulations are adequate for normal buildings but may not take into account the special issues of large and complicated buildings, like shopping centres, assembly facilities, etc. Numerical simulation of fire and evacuation processes can be used to improve fire safety in such buildings. However, the usability of many current evacuation models is limited, because they do not take into account the individual properties and decision making processes of humans, the dynamics of large crowds and the interaction between fire and people. In this article, a recently presented evacuation programme is developed further. The code allows the modelling of 'panic' situations and the interaction between evacuation simulation and the state-of-the-art fire simulation. The major features of the human movement algorithm are described. A reaction function model for exit route selection and some social interactions among agents are introduced into the computer programme. This computational tool for evacuation modelling is implemented as a part of the state-of-the-art fire simulation tool Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). Like the current version of FDS, the evacuation module, FDS+Evac, presented in this article is made publicly and freely available.},

 abstract = {The social force model of Helbing and Moln\'ar is one of the best known approaches to simulate pedestrian motion, a collective phenomenon with nonlinear dynamics. It is based on the idea that the Newtonian laws of motion mostly carry over to pedestrian motion so that human trajectories can be computed by solving a set of ordinary differential equations for velocity and acceleration. The beauty and simplicity of this ansatz are strong reasons for its wide spread. However, the numerical implementation is not without pitfalls. Oscillations, collisions, and instabilities occur even for very small step sizes. Classic solution ideas from molecular dynamics do not apply to the problem because the system is not Hamiltonian despite its source of inspiration. Looking at the model through the eyes of a mathematician, however, we realize that the right hand side of the differential equation is nondifferentiable and even discontinuous at critical locations. This produces undesirable behavior in the exact solution and, at best, severe loss of accuracy in efficient numerical schemes even in short range simulations. We suggest a very simple mollified version of the social force model that conserves the desired dynamic properties of the original many-body system but elegantly and cost efficiently resolves several of the issues concerning stability and numerical resolution.},

surface. This is not the case for movement on stairs. Experiments show that pedestrians
slow down when climbing or descending stairs. Hence, it is tempting to model
movement on stairs by simply slowing down by a factor. But this would imply that,
other than being slower, motion on stairs mirrors motion in the plane. Is that assumption
justified? We conduct field observations that reveal similarities but also
significant differences. Thus we argue that modeling movement on stairs by slowing
down free-flow velocities may be an acceptable first shot. True microscopic
behavior, however, like treading from step to step and keeping to a straight line instead
of trying to overtake can only be captured by a dedicated model. We present
an extension to the Optimal Steps Model that achieves this.},

The distribution of horizontal walking speeds exhibits a maximum between 0.4 and 0.5 m/s, depending on the local density. To underline the need to measure walking speeds on long stairways if one wants to predict travelling times on long stairways, these results are compared to a second study of walking speeds on a short stair. The main result of that measurement is, that some people actually accelerate when walking upward a short stairway, while such a phenomenon could neither be observed for downward motion on the short stairway nor for upward motion on the long stairway. The mean upward walking speed on the short stairway was found to be roughly twice as large as the one on the long stairway, which corresponds to the data found in the literature. Both studies were done by digitally filming the walking persons and evaluating the resulting material frame by frame for the walking times. Together the results suggest, that the speed on stairs does not only vary greatly depending on the length of the stairway, but also that there is no common scaling factor for the speed on stairs in dependence of the length of the stairway for the whole population. This has consequences, e.g. for the construction of simulation models.},

The assessment includes both: benefits for pedestrian and potential drawbacks for vehicular traffic. It will be shown in detail that clear benefits for pedestrians and for public transport are opposed by only small - if at all - drawbacks for vehicular traffic. It is concluded that multi-modal micro-simulation is a powerful tool to handle all traffic modes with equal care and equal rights in the planning process and that it is at the same time a powerful tool to produce material for communication with the public.},

 abstract = {This work combines a review and a research need statement part. In
the review part some indications are collected that for the variation of
walking speeds stride length is varied more than stride frequency. It is
argued that this limits the variation of walking speeds on stairs where the
stride length is fixed as long as one stair is taken at a time. Furthermore
data from various sources is presented that indicates that for upstairs
movement there is a limit for vertical speed stemming from general hu-
man performance limits. This limit adds to the restriction of (up-)stairs
walking speeds.
The research need statement part of the paper demonstrates that a
simulation of pedestrian dynamics predicts a smaller 
ow (and consequently larger evacuation times) if pedestrians have a different percentile
regarding the speed distributions for 
at and stairs movement. This is
an interesting phenomenon since a bottleneck is created which depends
on the dynamic interplay between the walking geometry and properties
of the population. It is therefore desirable to investigate the phenomenon
not only with simulations but also empirically.},

these robots need to understand and comply with mutually accepted rules. In this paper, we present a novel approach to
model the cooperative navigation behavior of humans. We model their behavior in terms of a mixture distribution that
captures both the discrete navigation decisions, such as going left or going right, as well as the natural variance of human
trajectories. Our approach learns the model parameters of this distribution that match, in expectation, the observed behavior in terms of user-defined features. To compute the feature expectations over the resulting high-dimensional continuous
distributions, we use Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Furthermore, we rely on a Voronoi graph of the
environment to efficiently explore the space of trajectories from the robot'scurrent position to its target position. Using the
proposed model, our method is able to imitate the behavior of pedestrians or, alternatively, to replicate a specific behavior
that was taught by tele-operation in the target environment of the robot. We implemented our approach on a real mobile
robot and demonstrated that it is able to successfully navigate in an office environment in the presence of humans. An
extensive set of experiments suggests that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods to model the behavior of
pedestrians, which also makes it applicable to fields such as behavioral science or computer graphics.},

 abstract = {Transport simulation models exist on multiple scales from evacuation simulations of nightclubs
with a few hundred guests over the simulation of transport hubs such as large train stations up to
evacuation simulations of megapolis in case of tsunamis. Depending on precision and complexity
requirements, continuous (e.g. force-based, velocity obstacle based), spatiotemporal discrete (e.g.
cellular automata), or queue models are applied. In general, the finer the spatiotemporal resolution
the more precise the interactions between travelers (e.g. pedestrians or vehicles) are captured, but
the computational burden increases. The obvious approach to achieve higher computational speeds
is to reduce the physical complexity (e.g. by using a queue model), which in turn also reduces the
precision. One way to increase the computational speed while staying precise enough to make
reliable prognosis is to combine models of different scale in a hybrid manner, where a finer model
is applied where needed and a coarser model where plausible. This contribution discusses an
application of a hybrid simulation approach in the context of a large-scale multi- and inter-modal
evacuation scenario. The presented case study investigates the feasibility of an evacuation of parts
of the city of Hamburg in Germany in case of a storm surge.},

 abstract = {Queues involve waiting, to be sure, but one's attitudes toward queues may be influenced more strongly by other factors. For instance, customers may become infuriated if they experience social injustice, defined as violation of first in, first out. Queueing environment and feedback regarding the likely magnitude of the delay can also influence customer attitudes and ultimately, in many instances, a firm's market share. Even if we focus on the wait itself, the "outcome" of the queueing experience may vary nonlinearly with the delay, thus reducing the importance of average time in queue, the traditional measure of queueing performance. This speculative paper uses personal experiences, published and unpublished cases, and occasionally "the literature" to begin to organize our thoughts on the important attributes of queueing. To flesh out more of these issues, the author asks for your cards and letters.},

 abstract = {Many witnesses attest that victims of a disaster often perish because they freeze in the face of danger. It has been proposed that this cognitive paralysis occurs due to temporal and cognitive constraints on survival response times while leaving open the question of which cognitive component is implicated in this behavior. This paper proposes, firstly, that the temporal constraints which occur during an emergency inhibit the functioning of the supervisory attentional system (SAS), which leads to the victim showing: 1) an appropriate response, if trained; 2) stereotypical or otherwise irrational behavior, if untrained; or 3) cognitive paralysis. Secondly, that the main role of the SAS is to operate as a temporal buffer, enabling a survival response to be prepared prior to facing a life-threatening event and not as a real-time immediate responder. It is argued that the initial cognitive paralysis differs at the cognitive and neurological levels from the more prolonged hypoactive behavior commonly seen in victims rescued from disasters and which is considered to be a form of disassociative reaction.},

The effect is difficult to detect, and discussion of the possible process of magnetic field detection by birds seems so far to have foundered on the simple fact that the orientational effect of the Earth's magnetic field on a single electron spin associated with a molecule of animal tissue would be of the order 10-8 eV - almost certainly too small to be detectable biologically. Here I direct attention to a process which would overcome this basic problem, and which also seems to provide an explanation of all the main features of published data. It is a mechanism in principle only, however, and is discussed here in no more detail than is necessary to clarify the basic ideas and to provide a basis for further investigation.},

 abstract = {Evacuation processes of students are investigated by experiment and simulation. The
experiment is performed for students evacuating from a dormitory with an exit and stairs.
FDS+Evac is proposed to simulate the exit and stair dynamics of occupant evacuation.
Concerning the exit and stair widths, we put forward some useful standpoints. Good
agreement is achieved between the predicted results and experimental results. With the
increase of exit width, a significant stratification phenomenon will be found in flow rate.
Stratification phenomenon is that two different stable flow rates will emerge during the
evacuation. And the flow rate curve looks like a ladder. The larger the exit width, the earlier
the stratification phenomenon appears. When exit width is more than 2.0 m, the flow rate
of each exit width is divided into two stable stages, and the evacuation times show almost
no change. The judgment that the existence of stairs causes flow stratification is reasonable.
By changing the width of the stairs, we proved that judgment. The smaller the width of
BC, the earlier the stratification appears. We found that scenario 5 is the most adverse
circumstance. Those results are helpful in performance-based design of buildings.},

 abstract = {Reconstruction is a key step of the motion capture process. The quality of motion data first results from the quality of raw data. However, it also depends on the motion reconstruction step, especially when raw data suffer markers losses or noise due, for example, to challenging conditions of capture. Labeling is a final and crucial data reconstruction step that enables practical use of motion data (e.g., analysis). The lower the data quality, the more time consuming and tedious the labeling step, because human intervention cannot be avoided: he has to manually indicate markers label each time a loss of the marker in time occurs. In the context of crowd study, we faced such situation when we performed experiments on the locomotion of groups of people. Data reconstruction poses several problems such as markers labeling, interpolation and mean position computation. While Vicon IQ software has difficulties to automatically label markers for the crowd experiment we carried out, we propose a specific method to label our data and estimate participants mean positions with incomplete data.},

Data collected from a thorough investigation of the SPE archives and interviews with 15 of the participants in the experiment further question the study's scientific merit. These data are not only supportive of previous criticisms of the SPE, such as the presence of demand characteristics, but provide new criticisms of the SPE based on heretofore unknown information. These new criticisms include the biased and incomplete collection of data, the extent to which the SPE drew on a prison experiment devised and conducted by students in one of Zimbardo's classes 3 months earlier, the fact that the guards received precise instructions regarding the treatment of the prisoners, the fact that the guards were not told they were subjects, and the fact that participants were almost never completely immersed by the situation. Possible explanations of the inaccurate textbook portrayal and general misperception of the SPE's scientific validity over the past 5 decades, in spite of its flaws and shortcomings, are discussed.},

 abstract = {Psychology tells us that the different level of tension may lead to different behavior variation for individuals. In this paper, an extended cost potential field cellular automaton is proposed to simulate pedestrian counter flow under an emergency by considering behavior variation of pedestrian induced by psychological tension. A quantitative formula is introduced to describe behavioral changes caused by psychological tension, which also leads to the increasing cost of discomfort. The numerical simulations are performed under the periodic boundary condition and show that the presented model can capture some essential features of pedestrian counter flow, such as lane formation and segregation phenomenon for normal condition. Furthermore, an interesting feature is found that when pedestrians are in an extremely nervous state, a stable lane formation will be broken by a disordered mixture flow. The psychological nervousness under an emergency is not always negative to moving efficiency and a moderate level of tension will delay the occurrence of jamming phase. In addition, a larger asymmetrical ratio of left walkers to right walkers will improve the critical density related to the jamming phase and retard the occurrence of completely jammed phase. These findings will be helpful in pedestrian control and management under an emergency.},

 abstract = {Few studies have focused on the evacuation of multi-floor classroom buildings in a primary school, a process that differs from evacuations in other buildings. A stair-unit model was proposed to describe the spatial topology of twisting stairwells and to describe the spatial relationship between stairwells and floors. Based on the stair-unit model, a schedule-line model was proposed to calculate evacuation paths in stair-units; a modified algorithm to calculate pedestrian forces were proposed to describe the evacuee movements in stairwells; and a projection strategy was proposed to model the 3-dimensional evacuation process in multi-floor buildings. The simulated processes were compared with a real evacuation drill. The results showed that the simulated process achieved qualitative and quantitative consistencies with the real drill, proving the appropriateness of the proposed models and algorithms. Based on the validation, further simulations were conducted and a few rules for evacuations in stairwells were identified including rules governing the impact of the moment of entering a staircase, the number of students in a class, the stagger strategy, and the layout of grades on different floors on the time in stairwell and the total evacuation duration. The results can be used to mitigate the effects of a fire disaster, and the proposed models and algorithms can also be referenced by evacuation simulation for other multi-floor buildings such as residential buildings.},

 abstract = {Merging flows involve complex interactions between pedestrians, which will restrict the efficiency of the evacuation process in emergency situations, such as fires. However, experimental research on merging behavior is limited. This paper describes pedestrian behavior in a merging channel where the branch flow joins the main flow at a junction area. The width of the main channel was fixed at 3.2m while the branch had a changeable value of 0.8m, 1.6m and 2.4m, respectively. Up to 295 university students took part in the experiments and all trajectories were extracted using the mean-shift algorithm. Lane formation was found downstream in the main channel and the increasing amplitude of the lane width formed by the branch flow became weaker with the increasing width of the branch channel. The saturated flow was approximately 4.9ped/s (1.5ped/m/s) and when the branch channel was 2.4m, the main and branch channel became mutual bottlenecks to each other. Moreover, microscopic characteristics of pedestrian interaction were analyzed. Velocity-position relationships with the 1.6m and 2.4m branch widths showed the velocity in the main channel decreased when pedestrians got close to the merging area and the velocity in the branch channel was suppressed significantly compared to that with the 0.8m branch. Density in the corner increased when the branch width increased and reached about 6ped/m2 when the branch width was 2.4m. What's more, pedestrian flow in the branch became jammed in this situation. The results can be used to calibrate pedestrian simulation models and improve public infrastructure design.},

 abstract = {This paper uses the method of kinematic waves, developed in part I, but may be read independently. A functional relationship between flow and concentration for traffic on crowded arterial roads has been postulated for some time, and has experimental backing (\S2). From this a theory of the propagation of changes in traffic distribution along these roads may be deduced (\S\S2, 3). The theory is applied (\S4) to the problem of estimating how a ``hump'', or region of increased concentration, will move along a crowded main road. It is suggested that it will move slightly slower than the mean vehicle speed, and that vehicles passing through it will have to reduce speed rather suddenly (at a ``shock wave'') on entering it, but can increase speed again only very gradually as they leave it. The hump gradually spreads out along the road, and the time scale of this process is estimated. The behaviour of such a hump on entering a bottleneck, which is too narrow to admit the increased flow, is studied (\S5), and methods are obtained for estimating the extent and duration of the resulting hold-up. The theory is applicable principally to traffic behaviour over a long stretch of road, but the paper concludes (\S6) with a discussion of its relevance to problems of flow near junctions, including a discussion of the starting flow at a controlled junction. In the introductory sections 1 and 2, we have included some elementary material on the quantitative study of traffic flow for the benefit of scientific readers unfamiliar with the subject.},

 abstract = {A series of accidents caused by crowds within the last decades evoked a lot of scientific interest in modeling the movement of pedestrian crowds. Based on the discrete element method, a granular dynamic model, in which the human body is simplified as a self-driven sphere, is proposed to simulate the characteristics of crowd flow through an exit. In this model, the repulsive force among people is considered to have an anisotropic feature, and the physical contact force due to body deformation is quantified by the Hertz contact model. The movement of the human body is simulated by applying the second Newton's law. The crowd flow through an exit at different desired velocities is studied and simulation results indicated that crowd flow exhibits three distinct states, i.e., smooth state, transition state and phase separation state. In the simulation, the clogging phenomenon occurs more easily when the desired velocity is high and the exit may as a result be totally blocked at a desired velocity of 1.6 m/s or above, leading to faster-to-frozen effect.},

 abstract = {Crowd force by the pushing or crushing of people has resulted in a number of accidents in recent decades. The aftermath investigations have shown that the physical interaction of a highly competitive crowd could produce dangerous pressure up to 4500 N/m, which leads to compressive asphyxia or even death. In this paper, a numerical model based on discrete element method (DEM) as referenced from granular flow was proposed to model the evacuation process of a group of highly competitive people, in which the movement of people follows Newton's second law and the body deformation due to compression follows Hertz contact model. The study shows that the clogs occur periodically and flow rate fluctuates greatly if all people strive to pass through a narrow exit at high enough desired velocity. Two types of contact forces acting on people are studied. The first one, i.e., vector contact force, accounts for the movement of the people following Newton's second law. The second one, i.e., scale contact force, accounts for the physical deformation of the human body following the contact law. Simulation shows that the forces chain in crowd flow is turbulent and fragile. A few narrow zones with intense forces are observed in the force field, which is similar to the strain localization observed in granular flow. The force acting on a person could be as high as 4500 N due to force localization, which may be the root cause of compressive asphyxia of people in many crowd incidents.},

 abstract = {Guaranteeing a safe, efficient, and comfortable traveling system for pedestrians is one of the most important aspects of an intelligent transportation system. The microscopic simulation of pedestrian flow has attracted increasing research attention in recent years since a reliable simulation model for pedestrian flow may greatly benefit engineers and operators in mass transportation management, as well as designers and planners in urban planning and architecture. This paper introduces CityFlow, an agent-based microscopic pedestrian flow simulation model. The building floor plan in the model is represented by a continuous space constructed in a network approach, and each pedestrian is regarded as a self-adapted agent. Agent movement is implemented in a utility maximization approach by considering various human behaviors. The influences of parameters in the model on the simulation results are investigated. Typical pedestrian flow phenomena, including the unidirectional and bidirectional flow in a corridor as well as the flow through bottlenecks, are simulated. The simulation results are further compared with empirical study results. The comparison reveals that the model can approach the density-speed fundamental diagrams and the empirical flow rates at bottlenecks within acceptable system dimensions. The simulation results of the bidirectional pedestrian flow also show that the model can reproduce the lane-formation phenomenon.},

Then, we performed a series of experiments to test the hypotheses. With several analytical methods, e.g., the proxemics theory and Voronoi diagram method, the features of pedestrian inflow are analyzed in detail. Results demonstrate that the distribution of pedestrians in the room is not uniform. Boundaries are attractive for these pedestrians. The impact of two factors of the inflow are analyzed, i.e., movement rule, and first-out reward. It is found pedestrians can enter the room more effectively under the random rule or two queues. Under some hurry circumstances, pedestrians may prefer to gather around the door, and the spatial distribution is not uniform, leading to the imbalance use of the room. Practical suggestions are given for pedestrians to improve the travel efficiency in the inflow process. This experimental study is meaningful to reveal some fundamental phenomena of inflow process, which can provide the realistic basis for building the theory and mathematical-physical models.},

  abstract = {Pedestrian inflow process frequently occurs in various pedestrian facilities in our daily life. Great importance should be attached to the study of this process. In this paper, we explore the pedestrian inflow process in a room with a separate entrance and exit. Two kinds of experiments are conducted: experiment 1 has no inactive persons and primarily focuses on analyzing the features of the normal pedestrian inflow process and analyzing the representative spatial parameters in the steady state, while experiment 2 involves the influence of the inactive persons. In order to quantitatively discuss the distribution of pedestrians in the steady state, we adopt several analytical methods, such as the Voronoi diagram method, proxemics, and point pattern analysis. Some features of the inflow process are captured. The distribution of pedestrians in the steady state is not uniform. The proxemics and attraction to the exit are both considered to affect pedestrians distribution in the inflow process. The presence of inactive persons may have an impact on both the inflow and outflow processes. Practical suggestions are provided for the managers of pedestrian facilities.},

This paper proposes a novel methodology to calibrate these models using experimental trajectories. The methodology is based on likelihood function optimization and allows verifying whether the parameters defining a model statistically affect pedestrian navigation. Moreover, it allows comparing different model specifications or the parameters of the same model estimated using different data collection techniques, e.g. virtual reality experiment, real data, etc. The methodology is here implemented using navigation data collected in a Virtual Reality tunnel evacuation experiment including 96 participants. A trajectory dataset in the proximity of an emergency exit is used to test and compare different metrics, i.e. Euclidean and modified Euclidean distance, for the static floor field. In the present case study, modified Euclidean metrics provide better fitting with the data. A new formulation using random parameters for pedestrian cellular automaton models is also defined and tested.},

Augmented Reality (AR) is novel technology that can enhance this process providing building occupants with virtual contents to improve their evacuation performance. This work aims at reviewing existing AR applications developed for building evacuation. This review identifies the disasters and types of building those tools have been applied for. Moreover, the application goals, hardware and evacuation stages affected by AR are also investigated in the review. Finally, this review aims at identifying the challenges to face for further development of AR evacuation tools.},

 abstract = {Modeling pedestrian movement is an interesting problem both in statistical physics and in computational physics. Update schemes of cellular automaton (CA) models for pedestrian dynamics govern the schedule of pedestrian movement. Usually, different update schemes make the models behave in different ways, which should be carefully recalibrated. Thus, in this paper, we investigated the influence of four different update schemes, namely parallel/synchronous scheme, random scheme, order-sequential scheme and shuffled scheme, on pedestrian dynamics. The multi-velocity floor field cellular automaton (FFCA) considering the changes of pedestrians? moving properties along walking paths and heterogeneity of pedestrians? walking abilities was used. As for parallel scheme only, the collisions detection and resolution should be considered, resulting in a great difference from any other update schemes. For pedestrian evacuation, the evacuation time is enlarged, and the difference in pedestrians? walking abilities is better reflected, under parallel scheme. In face of a bottleneck, for example a exit, using a parallel scheme leads to a longer congestion period and a more dispersive density distribution. The exit flow and the space?time distribution of density and velocity have significant discrepancies under four different update schemes when we simulate pedestrian flow with high desired velocity. Update schemes may have no influence on pedestrians in simulation to create tendency to follow others, but sequential and shuffled update scheme may enhance the effect of pedestrians? familiarity with environments.},

 abstract = {A recent field study confirmed that animal crowd behavior is dominated by the interaction from the k-Nearest-Neighbors rather than all the neighbors in a given metric distance. For the reason that systems with local interaction perform similar self-organized phenomena, we in this paper build two models, i.e.,??a metric distance based model and a k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) counterflow model, based on a simple discrete cellular automaton model entitled the basic model, to investigate the fundamental interaction ruling pedestrian counter flow. Pedestrians move in a long channel and as a result are divided into left moving pedestrians and right moving pedestrians. These pedestrians interact with each other in different forms in different models. In the metric distance based model, ones direction of chosen behavior is influenced by all those who are in a small metric distance and come from the opposite direction; while in the kNN counterflow model, ones direction of chosen behavior is influenced by the distribution of a fixed number of the k-Nearest neighbors coming from the opposite direction. The self-organized lane formation is captured and factors affecting the number of lanes formed in the channel are investigated. Results imply that with varying density, the lane formation pattern is almost the same in the kNN counterflow model while it is not in the case of metric distance based model. This means that the kNN interaction plays a more fundamental role in the emergence of collective pedestrian phenomena. Then the kNN counterflow model is further validated by comparing the lane formation pattern and the fundamental diagram with real pedestrian counter flow. Reasons for the lane formation and improvement of flow rate are discussed. The relations among mean velocity, occupancy and total entrance density of the model are also studied. The results indicate that the kNN interaction provides a more efficient traffic condition, and is able to quantify features such as segregation and phase transition at high density of pedestrian traffic.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach for simulating pedestrian movement behavior based on artificial intelligence technology. Within this approach, a large volume of microscopic pedestrian movement behavior types were collected and encapsulated into an artificial neural network via network training. The trained network was then fed back into a simulation environment to predict the pedestrian movement. Two simulation experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the approach. First, a pedestrian-collision-avoidance test was conducted, and the results showed that virtual pedestrians with learned pedestrian behavior can move reasonably to avoid potential collisions with other pedestrians. In addition, a critical parameter, i.e., defined as reacting distance and determined to be 2.5 m, represented the boundary of the collision buffer zone. Second, a pedestrian counterflow in a road-crossing situation was simulated, and the results were compared with the real-life scenario. The comparison revealed that the pedestrian distributions, erratic trajectories, and density-speed fundamental diagram in the simulation are reasonably consistent with the real-life scenario. Furthermore, a quantitative indicator, i.e., the relative distance error, was calculated to evaluate the simulation error of pedestrians trajectories between the simulation and the real-life scenario, the mean of which was calculated to be 0.322. This revealed that the simulation results were acceptable from an engineering perspective, and they also showed that the approach could reproduce the lane-formation phenomenon. We considered the proposed approach to be capable of simulating human-like microscopic pedestrian flow.},

 abstract = {Few studies have focused on the evacuation of multi-floor classroom buildings in a primary school, a process that differs from evacuations in other buildings. A stair-unit model was proposed to describe the spatial topology of twisting stairwells and to describe the spatial relationship between stairwells and floors. Based on the stair-unit model, a schedule-line model was proposed to calculate evacuation paths in stair-units; a modified algorithm to calculate pedestrian forces were proposed to describe the evacuee movements in stairwells; and a projection strategy was proposed to model the 3-dimensional evacuation process in multi-floor buildings. The simulated processes were compared with a real evacuation drill. The results showed that the simulated process achieved qualitative and quantitative consistencies with the real drill, proving the appropriateness of the proposed models and algorithms. Based on the validation, further simulations were conducted and a few rules for evacuations in stairwells were identified including rules governing the impact of the moment of entering a staircase, the number of students in a class, the stagger strategy, and the layout of grades on different floors on the time in stairwell and the total evacuation duration. The results can be used to mitigate the effects of a fire disaster, and the proposed models and algorithms can also be referenced by evacuation simulation for other multi-floor buildings such as residential buildings.},

  abstract = {On its opening day, the London Millennium Bridge (LMB) experienced unexpected large amplitude lateral vibrations due to crowd loading. This form of pedestrian--structure interaction has since been identified on several other bridges of various structural forms. The mechanism has generally been attributed to 'pedestrian synchronous lateral excitation' or 'pedestrian lock-in'. However, some of the more recent site measurements have shown a lack of evidence of pedestrian synchronization, at least at the onset of the behaviour. This paper considers a simple model of human balance from the biomechanics field--the inverted pendulum model--for which the most effective means of lateral stabilization is by the control of the position, rather than the timing, of foot placement. The same balance strategy as for normal walking on a stationary surface is applied to walking on a laterally oscillating bridge. As a result, without altering their pacing frequency, averaged over a large number of cycles, the pedestrian effectively acts as a negative (or positive) damper to the bridge motion, which may be at a different frequency. This is in agreement with the empirical model developed by Arup from the measurements on the LMB, leading to divergent amplitude vibrations above a critical number of pedestrians.},

 abstract = {The collective movement of animals in a group is an impressive phenomenon whereby large scale spatio-temporal patterns emerge from simple interactions between individuals. Theoretically, much of our understanding of animal group motion comes from models inspired by statistical physics. In these models, animals are treated as moving (self-propelled) particles that interact with each other according to simple rules. Recently, researchers have shown greater interest in using experimental data to verify which rules are actually implemented by a particular animal species. In our study, we present a rigorous selection between alternative models inspired by the literature for a system of glass prawns. We find that the classic theoretical models can accurately capture either the fine-scale behaviour or the large-scale collective patterns of movement of the prawns. However, none are able to reproduce both levels of description at the same time. To resolve this conflict we introduce a new class of models wherein prawns 'remember', their previous interactions, integrating their experiences over time when deciding to change behaviour. These outperform the traditional models in predicting when individual prawns will change their direction of motion and restore consistency between the fine-scale rules of interaction and the global behaviour of the group.},

Both strategies are focused on obtaining a good vector quantizier that represents adequately the state space of the agents.

At the lowest level, local interactions between agents occur; at the middle level, strategic
and tactical behaviors appear like overtakings or route choices; and at the highest level

independently manage the different behavioral levels. In our Multi-Agent Reinforcement-Learning-based Pedestrian simulation framework (MARL-Ped) the situation is
addressed as a whole. Each embodied agent uses a model-free Reinforcement Learning

goal of this work is to demonstrate empirically that MARL-Ped generates learned behaviors
adapted to the level required by the pedestrian scenario. Three different experiments,
described in the pedestrian modeling literature, are presented to test our approach: (i)
election of the shortest path vs. quickest path; (ii) a crossing between two groups of pedestrians walking in opposite directions inside a narrow corridor; (iii) two agents that move in
opposite directions inside a maze. The results show that MARL-Ped solves the different
problems, learning individual behaviors with characteristics of pedestrians (local control
that produces adequate fundamental diagrams, route-choice capability, emergence of
collective behaviors and path-planning). Besides, we compared our model with that of Helbing's social forces, a well-known model of pedestrians, showing similarities between the
pedestrian dynamics generated by both approaches. These results demonstrate empirically
that MARL-Ped generates variate plausible behaviors, producing human-like macroscopic
pedestrian flow.},

In two experiments a standard floor plan was compared to three strongly schematised maps providing only route knowledge. With the help of one of the maps, the participants had to localise themselves in two tasks and performed two wayfinding tasks in a multi-level building they didnt know before. We recorded map usage time and a range of task performance measures. Although the map provided much less information, participants performed better in wayfinding with an unambiguous schematic map than with a floor plan. In the self localisation tasks, participants performed equally well with the detailed floor plan and with the schematised map versions. Like the users of a schematic map, users of a floor map presumably oriented on the network structure rather than on local geometric features. This allows them to limit the otherwise potentially very large search space in map-based self localisation. In both types of tasks participants looked at the schematised maps for a shorter time. Providing less than standard information like in a highly schematised map can lead to better performance. We conclude that providing unambiguous turning information (route knowledge) rather than survey knowledge is most crucial for wayfinding in unknown environments.},

 abstract = {Social influence is the process by which individuals adapt their opinion, revise their beliefs, or change their behavior as a result of social interactions with other people. In our strongly interconnected society, social influence plays a prominent role in many self-organized phenomena such as herding in cultural markets, the spread of ideas and innovations, and the amplification of fears during epidemics. Yet, the mechanisms of opinion formation remain poorly understood, and existing physics-based models lack systematic empirical validation. Here, we report two controlled experiments showing how participants answering factual questions revise their initial judgments after being exposed to the opinion and confidence level of others. Based on the observation of 59 experimental subjects exposed to peer-opinion for 15 different items, we draw an influence map that describes the strength of peer influence during interactions. A simple process model derived from our observations demonstrates how opinions in a group of interacting people can converge or split over repeated interactions. In particular, we identify two major attractors of opinion: (i) the expert effect, induced by the presence of a highly confident individual in the group, and (ii) the majority effect, caused by the presence of a critical mass of laypeople sharing similar opinions. Additional simulations reveal the existence of a tipping point at which one attractor will dominate over the other, driving collective opinion in a given direction. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of public opinion formation and managing conflicting situations in which self-confident and better informed minorities challenge the views of a large uninformed majority.},

 abstract = {Although cooperation is central to the organisation of many social systems, relatively little is known about cooperation in situations of collective emergency. When groups of people flee from a danger such as a burning building or a terrorist attack, the collective benefit of cooperation is important, but the cost of helping is high and the temptation to defect is strong. To explore the degree of cooperation in emergencies, we develop a new social game, the help-or-escape social dilemma. Under time and monetary pressure, players decide how much risk they are willing to take in order to help others. Results indicated that players took as much risk to help others during emergencies as they did under normal conditions. In both conditions, most players applied an egalitarian heuristic and helped others until their chance of success equalled that of the group. This strategy is less efficient during emergencies, however, because the increased time pressure results in fewer people helped. Furthermore, emergencies tend to amplify participants' initial tendency to cooperate, with prosocials becoming even more cooperative and individualists becoming even more selfish. Our framework offers new opportunities to study human cooperation and could help authorities to better manage crowd behaviours during mass emergencies.},

 abstract = {We propose and analyze extended floor field cellular automaton models
for evacuation dynamics of inhomogeneous pedestrian pairs which are coupled by
asymmetric group interactions. Such pairs consist of a leader, who mainly determines
the couple s motion and a follower, who has a defined tendency to follow the
leader. Examples for such pairs are mother and child or two siblings of different age.
We examine the system properties and compare them to the case of a homogeneous
crowd. We find a strong impact on evacuation times for the regime of strong pair
coupling due to the occurrence of a clogging phenomenon. In addition we obtain a
non-trivial dependence of evacuation times on the followers coupling to the static
floor field, which carries the information of the shortest way to the exit location. In
particular we find that systems with fully passive followers, who are solely coupled
to their leaders, show lower evacuation times than homogeneous systems where all
pedestrians have an equal tendency to move towards the exit.We compare the results
of computer simulations with recently performed experiments.},

There are two types of walkers without the back step: the one is the random walker going to the right and the other is the random walker going to the left. It is found that a dynamical jamming transition from the freely moving state at low density to the stopped state at high density occurs at the critical density. The transition point is given by pc=0.45??0.01, not depending on the system size. The transition point depends on the strength of drift and decreases with increasing drift.

 abstract = {A simple, rule-based approach to traffic flow can yield astonishingly realistic results and is therefore a candidate for very fast large scale microscopic traffic simulations. In the present article, we evaluate two conceptually different codings of the same dynamics on parallel supercomputers. We use a Parsytec GCel-3 (1024 nodes), an Intel iPSC/860 (32 nodes), and a Connection Machine CM-5 (32 nodes). For comparison purposes, we use as well a NEC-SX3/11 traditional single node vector computer, and a net of coupled workstations. Compared to published computing speeds of microscopic traffic models, our model proves to be up to about 1000 times faster. We find our highest computing speed by employing a single-bit coding scheme used in, e.g., Ising-model programming. As traffic flow is a one-dimensional problem, a complication is that geometric parallelization has to be done in the same direction as single-bit coding. Nevertheless, we reach efficiencies near 100 percent for large systems. We use these computational resources in order to obtain high quality data of the model's average behavior (fundamental diagrams). In addition, we present results from modeling a road network, whose composition out of basic objects leads in a natural way to some temporal 'slackness' which helps balancing load asymmetries.},

The final product of the estimation process is an origin-destination (OD) matrix, whose entries correspond to the number of trips between pairs of origin-destination zones in a study region. In this paper, we review the main statistical models proposed in the literature for the estimation of the OD matrix based on traffic counts. Unlike reconstruction models, statistical models do not aim at estimating the exact OD matrix corresponding to observed traffic volumes, but they rather aim at estimating the parameters of a statistical model of the population of OD matrices. Initially we define the estimation problem, emphasizing its underspecified nature, which has lead to the development of several models based on different approaches. We describe static models whose parameters are estimated by means of maximum likelihood, the method of moments, and Bayesian inference. We also describe some recent dynamic models. Following that, we discuss research questions related to the underspecification problem, model assumptions and the estimation of the route choice matrix, and indicate promising research directions.},

Inquiring into the possibility of a mechanical description of these dynamics, we experimentally study the crossing of dense static crowds by a cylindrical intruder, a mechanical test which is classical for granular matter. The analysis of our experiments reveals robust features in the crowd' response, comprising both similarities and discrepancies with the response of granular media. Common features include the presence of a depleted region behind the intruder and the short-range character of the perturbation. On the other hand, unlike grains, pedestrians anticipate the intruder's passage by moving much before contact and their displacements are mostly lateral, hence not aligned with the forces exerted by the intruder. Similar conclusions are reached when the intruder is not a cylinder, but a single crossing pedestrian. Thus, our work shows that pedestrian interactions even at high densities (3 to 6 ped/m2) do not reduce to mechanical ones. More generally, the avoidance strategies evidenced by our findings question the incautious use of force models for dense crowds.},
  comment  = {<note author="gk"> The paper is very simple in its approach but with far reaching consequences. Sending an intruder, more precisely a moving pillar and later a person through a crowd, much in the way experiments with grains are set up, reveals patterns in the crowd density and the velocity fields that differ fundamentally from those observed when in an intrusive object is moved through granular matter. Forces rule in the agglomeration of grains. Force models reproduce very well the compression and flow within the granular matter. Force models do NOT reproduce the compression and flow in a crowd. Unlike grains, people anticipate and evade cleverly before they are pushed away by a force. Hence the paper warns about the uncautious use of force models for crowds. </note>},

 abstract = {Exposure to crowding is said to be aversive, yet people also seek out and enjoy crowded situations. We surveyed participants at two crowd events to test the prediction of self-categorization theory that variable emotional responses to crowding are a function of social identification with the crowd. In data collected from participants who attended a crowded outdoor music event (n = 48), identification with the crowd predicted feeling less crowded; and there was an indirect effect of identification with the crowd on positive emotion through feeling less crowded. Identification with the crowd also moderated the relation between feeling less crowded and positive emotion. In data collected at a demonstration march (n =112), identification with the crowd predicted central (most dense) location in the crowd; and there was an indirect effect of identification with the crowd on positive emotion through central location in the crowd. Positive emotion in the crowd also increased over the duration of the crowd event. These findings are in line with the predictions of self-categorization theory. They are inconsistent with approaches that suggest that crowding is inherently aversive; and they cannot easily be explained through the concept of "personal space".},

 abstract = {This paper concerns a review and critical assessment of the existing research on pedestrian behaviour in urban areas, focusing on two separate yet complementary aspects: route choice and crossing behaviour. First, an exhaustive review of the existing route choice models for pedestrians is presented. It is shown that the existing models are mainly more stochastic and more macroscopic than required and seldom incorporate the interactions between pedestrians and traffic. Second, the existing models on pedestrians crossing behaviour are presented and assessed. It is shown that, although their approach is usually detailed, deterministic and traffic-oriented, they are mainly devoted to a local level behaviour and focus on only one type of all the potential determinants. Most importantly, these two complementary and possibly interdependent aspects of pedestrian behaviour are always examined separately. The results of this review reveal a lack of an overall and detailed consideration of pedestrian behaviour along an entire trip in urban areas. Moreover, the need for an integrated approach based on flexibility, disaggregation and more determinism is identified. Accordingly, a set of modelling techniques are discussed as a general framework for further research in the field.},

It describes a method for solving interactions between pedestrians and avoiding inter-collisions. Our approach is agent-based and predictive: each agent perceives surrounding agents and extrapolates their trajectory in order to react to potential collisions. We aim at obtaining realistic results, thus the proposed model is calibrated from experimental motion capture data. Our method is shown to be valid and solves major drawbacks compared to previous approaches such as oscillations due to a lack of anticipation. We first describe the mathematical representation used in our model, we then detail its implementation, and finally, its calibration and validation from real data.},

  abstract = {The time that it takes an occupant population to reach safety when descending a stairwell during building evacuations is typically described by measurable engineering variables such as stairwell geometry, speed, density, and pre-evacuation delay. In turn, engineering models of building evacuation use these variables to predict the performance of egress systems for building design, emergency planning, or event reconstruction. As part of a program to better understand occupant movement and behavior during building emergencies, the Engineering Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been collecting stairwell movement data during fire drill evacuations of office buildings. These data collections are intended to provide a better understanding of this principal building egress feature and develop a technical foundation for future codes and standards requirements. To date, \{NIST\} has collected fire drill evacuation data in eight office building occupancies ranging from 6 to 62 stories in height that have included a range of stairwell widths and occupant densities. While average movement speeds in the current study of 0.48 m/s+/- 0.16 m/s are observed to be quite similar to the range of literature values, local movement speeds as occupants traverse down the stairwell are seen to vary widely within a given stairwell, ranging from 0.056 m/s to 1.7 m/s. These data should provide confirmation of the adequacy of existing literature values typically used for occupant movement speeds or provide updated values for future analyses.},

To this end we have analysed ants'-perspective views of a habitat within which desert ant navigation is well studied. Results from our analysis suggest that: parsimonious visual strategies for homing and route guidance are effective over behaviourally useful distances even in cluttered environments; that these strategies can function effectively using only the skyline heights as input; and that the simplicity and efficacy of using stored views as a visual compass makes it a viable and robust mechanism for route guidance.},

Several studies on Emergency Management exist in literature, but the majority of them do not consider how human behavior impacts the evacuation plan. Indeed, these can change drastically a critical scenario because are driven by emotions, knowledge and perception which are unpredictable. The aim of this study is to develop an ABM of an evacuation scenario due to a blast in a public area integrated with a mathematical dynamic human behavior model. Netlogo, which is a multi-agent programmable environment, was used to build the ABM. ABMs simulate two phases: the normal phase and the agent's evacuation process after the blast. The evacuation time is the main parameter of response and it is used to evaluate the efficiency and safety of an infrastructure. Each agent has its own behavior according to a layered framework mathematical model. The first layer, thanks to an empirical statistical distribution, simulates the "agent's state" function of the role performed by the agent and his age. Then the "individual module" describes the emotional aspects using the Decision Field Theory. This ABM becomes an important tool that enables designers or policy makers to test, estimating and improving the response of infrastructures in hazardous scenario.},

Results of 60 independent studies showed little support for (a) the occurrence of deindividuated (antinormative) behaviors or (b) the existence of a deindividuated state. Research results were explained more adequately by situation-specific than by general social norms. Analyses indicated that groups and individuals conform more to situation-specific norms when they are "deindividuated."

In the real-time strategy (RTS) genre, most developers are focusing on improving group movement for their next round of games. I'm not talking about the relatively low-tech methods cur- rently in use. Instead, I'm referring to coordinated group movement, where units cooperate with each other to move around the map with intelligence and cohesion. Any RTS game developer that wants to be competitive needs to look beyond simple unit movement; only the games that weigh in with solid coordinated movement systems will go the distance. In this article, the second and final part of my coordinated unit movement series, we'll take a look at how to use the systems that we considered in the first article to satisfy our coordinated group movement goal. We'll also examine how we can use our coordinated movement fundamentals to solve some classic, complex movement problems. While we will spend most of our time talking about these features through the RTS microscope, they can easily be applied to other types of games.},

 abstract = {An effective evacuation of buildings is critical to minimize casualties due to natural or anthropogenic hazards. Building evacuation models help in preparing for future events and shed light on possible shortcomings of current evacuation designs. However, such models are seldom compared or validated with real evacuations, which is a critical step in assessing their predictive capacities. This research focuses on the evacuation of a K-12 (kindergarten to 12th grade) school located within the tsunami inundation zone of Iquique, Chile. An agent-based evacuation model was developed to simulate the evacuation of approximately 1500 children and staff from the school during a global evacuation drill carried out for the entire city. The model simulates the motions of heterogeneous human agents, and the simulations were validated using video analysis of the real event. Resulting error estimations between predicted versus measured flow rates and evacuation times are 13.5\% and 5.9\%, respectively. The good agreement between the simulated and measured values can be attributed to the known distribution of students and staff at the start of the drill, and their known exposure to emergency preparedness protocols. However, the results presented herein show that this mathematical evacuation model can be used for logistical changes in the emergency planning.},

  abstract = {Physical distancing, as a measure to contain the spreading of Covid-19, is defining a "new normal". Unless belonging to a family, pedestrians in shared spaces are asked to observe a minimal (country-dependent) pairwise distance. Coherently, managers of public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are: "in which conditions non-family members infringed social distancing?", "Are there repeated offenders?", and "How are new crowd management measures performing?". Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging.
In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in real-time, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders and family members in a privacy-compliant way. Second, we present a thorough analysis of mutual distances and exposure-times in a Dutch train platform, comparing pre-Covid and current data via physics observables as Radial Distribution Functions. The versatility and simplicity of this approach, developed to analyze crowd management measures in public transport facilities, enable to tackle issues beyond physical distancing, for instance the privacy-respectful detection of groups and the analysis of their motion patterns.},

 abstract = {Automated calibration of microscopic traffic flow models is all but simple for a number of reasons, including the computational complexity of black-box optimization and the asymmetric importance of parameters in influencing model performances. The main objective of this paper is therefore to provide a robust methodology to simplify car-following models, that is, to reduce the number of parameters (to calibrate) without sensibly affecting the capability of reproducing reality. To this aim, variance-based sensitivity analysis is proposed and formulated in a 'factor fixing' setting. Among the novel contributions are a robust design of the Monte Carlo framework that also includes, as an analysis factor, the main nonparametric input of car-following models, i.e., the leader's trajectory, and a set of criteria for 'data assimilation' in car-following models. The methodology was applied to the intelligent driver model (IDM) and to all the trajectories in the 'reconstructed' Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) I80-1 data set. The analysis unveiled that the leader's trajectory is considerably more important than the parameters in affecting the variability of model performances. Sensitivity analysis also returned the importance ranking of the IDM parameters. Basing on this, a simplified model version with three (out of six) parameters is proposed. After calibrations, the full model and the simplified model show comparable performances, in face of a sensibly faster convergence of the simplified version.},

Group modeling is still an open challenging problem and has not been incorporated by existing crowd simulation models. Motivated by the need of group modeling for crowd behavior simulation, this paper presents a unified and well-defined framework for modeling the structure aspect of different groups in a pedestrian crowd. Both intra-group structure and inter-group relationships are considered and their effects on the crowd behavior are modeled. Based on this framework, an agent-based crowd simulation system is developed and crowd behavior simulations using two different group structures are presented. The simulation results show that the developed framework allows different group structures to be easily modeled. Besides, different group sizes, intra-group structures and inter-group relationships can have significant impacts on crowd behavior.},

Compared with original models that described the pedestrian's planar motion, our model introduces some mechanisms of the staircase movement, such as the influence of staircase geometry, the restriction of the step size and the optimal velocity selection. The body shape of each pedestrian is regarded as a set of three circles to precisely quantify the movement. In addition, the rotation dynamics are included into the model to describe the congestion effect. The improved model can obtain individual velocity under different staircase geometries and the flow characteristics of the evacuation dynamics. Some empirical data and a series of observations captured in two subway stations in Beijing are applied to study the characteristics and further validate the model. The results show that our model performs well consistent with the observed data. At last, simulations are implemented to find the solutions of estimating the evacuation time and evaluating the capacity of stair.},

Propositions are tested using a paradigm that both controls features of queue structure and allows collection of real-time data from people waiting. Data collected from 134 participants confirm that people closer to a service agent are more pleased than those further away. But people waiting in a single-queue structure are shown to feel more predictability and arousal than those waiting in a multiple-queue structure. Waiting in a multiple-queue structure is, however, shown to produce a sense of lack of justice, even when no objective inequalities exist. The study suggests a useful paradigm for evaluating alternative queue structures in a laboratory setting and provides insights about psychological aspects of waiting. Both the method and the results suggest an extensive agenda for future research.},

 abstract = {The analysis of motion crowds is concerned with the detection of potential hazards for individuals of the crowd. Existing methods analyze the statistics of pixel motion to classify non-dangerous or dangerous behavior, to detect outlier motions, or to estimate the mean throughput of people for an image region. We suggest a biologically inspired model for the analysis of motion crowds that extracts motion features indicative for potential dangers in crowd behavior. Our model consists of stages for motion detection, integration, and pattern detection that model functions of the primate primary visual cortex area (V1), the middle temporal area (MT), and the medial superior temporal area (MST), respectively. This model allows for the processing of motion transparency, the appearance of multiple motions in the same visual region, in addition to processing opaque motion. We suggest that motion transparency helps to identify "danger zones" in motion crowds. For instance, motion transparency occurs in small exit passages during evacuation. However, motion transparency occurs also for non-dangerous crowd behavior when people move in opposite directions organized into separate lanes. Our analysis suggests: The combination of motion transparency and a slow motion speed can be used for labeling of candidate regions that contain dangerous behavior. In addition, locally detected decelerations or negative speed gradients of motions are a precursor of danger in crowd behavior as are globally detected motion patterns that show a contraction toward a single point. In sum, motion transparency, image speeds, motion patterns, and speed gradients extracted from visual motion in videos are important features to describe the behavioral state of a motion crowd.},

This is unsatisfactory, because using this approach tests are more likely to validate a model if they have low power. Here we suggest the usage of tests of equivalence, which use the hypothesis of dissimilarity as the null hypothesis, that is, the null hypothesis is that the model is unacceptable. Thus, they flip the burden of proof back onto the model.

 abstract = {The definition of Validation and Verification (V\&V) tests for analysing evacuation model capabilities is the object of a large debate among researchers given the lack of an international standard. Four main types of tests have been reported in the literature, 1) component testing, 2) functional verification, 3) qualitative verification and 4) quantitative validation. An important issue relates to the stage in which the V\&V procedure is employed. In fact, the listed four forms of V\&V can be performed in two different stages, namely 1) after the model is built or 2) as an integral part of the model building process. The present study presents an example of the second strategy, i.e., the use of the V\&V tests as an integral part of the model building process. Examples are made in order to demonstrate the need for dedicated tests in relation to the type of model when adopting this strategy. A set of experimental data collected at the Department of Fire Safety Engineering and Systems Safety at Lund University (Sweden) has been employed to evaluate the capabilities of an evacuation model and provide guidance on its development. This was possible performing V\&V tests for which experimental data are generally scarce, i.e. quantitative validation. Results are used to identify the advantages deriving from the use of quantitative validation tests during the design stage of a model and assess some of the key aspects that need to be addressed in models which are not included in current V\&V tests/procedures.},

 abstract = {Evacuation models generally include the use of distributions or probabilistic variables to simulate the variability of possible human behaviours. A single model setup of the same evacuation scenario may therefore produce a distribution of different occupant-evacuation time curves in the case of the use of a random sampling method. This creates an additional component of uncertainty caused by the impact of the number of simulated runs of the same scenario on evacuation model predictions, here named behavioural uncertainty. To date there is no universally accepted quantitative method to evaluate behavioural uncertainty and the selection of the number of runs is left to a qualitative judgement of the model user. A simple quantitative method using convergence criteria based on functional analysis is presented to address this issue. The method permits (1) the analysis of the variability of model predictions in relation to the number of runs of the same evacuation scenario, i.e. the study of behavioural uncertainty and (2) the identification of the optimal number of runs of the same scenario in relation to pre-defined acceptance criteria.},

Pandemics such as COVID-19 have posed several questions on safe building usage, given the risk of disease
transmission among building occupants. Here we show how crowd modelling can be used to assess occupant
exposure in confined spaces. The policies adopted concerning building usage and social distancing during a
pandemic can vary greatly, and they are mostly based on the macroscopic analysis of the spread of disease rather
than a safety assessment performed at a building level. The proposed model allows the investigation of occupant
exposure in buildings based on the analysis of microscopic people movement. Risk assessment is performed by
retrofitting crowd models with a universal model for exposure assessment which can account for different types

 abstract = {Coordination among social animals requires rapid and efficient transfer of information among individuals, which may depend crucially on the underlying structure of the communication network. Establishing the decision-making circuits and networks that give rise to individual behavior has been a central goal of neuroscience. However, the analogous problem of determining the structure of the communication network among organisms that gives rise to coordinated collective behavior, such as is exhibited by schooling fish and flocking birds, has remained almost entirely neglected. Here, we study collective evasion maneuvers, manifested through rapid waves, or cascades, of behavioral change (a ubiquitous behavior among taxa) in schooling fish (Notemigonus crysoleucas). We automatically track the positions and body postures, calculate visual fields of all individuals in schools of ~150 fish, and determine the functional mapping between socially generated sensory input and motor response during collective evasion. We find that individuals use simple, robust measures to assess behavioral changes in neighbors, and that the resulting networks by which behavior propagates throughout groups are complex, being weighted, directed, and heterogeneous. By studying these interaction networks, we reveal the (complex, fractional) nature of social contagion and establish that individuals with relatively few, but strongly connected, neighbors are both most socially influential and most susceptible to social influence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can predict complex cascades of behavioral change at their moment of initiation, before they actually occur. Consequently, despite the intrinsic stochasticity of individual behavior, establishing the hidden communication networks in large self-organized groups facilitates a quantitative understanding of behavioral contagion.},

 abstract = {Escape way capacity calculation is an important item to realize safe buildings. In general, evacuation times are predicted by engineering methods with wide varieties in use and results. For example, Nelson defines capacity as a continuous and linear function to the escape way width. Hoogedoorn, however, describes a stepwise discontinuous increasing capacity.
To analyse the problem, a bottleneck experiment with students as test persons was arranged. The bottleneck width was varied in steps of 0.1 m starting with 0.8 m and ending with 1.2 m. The number of test persons was varied between 20, 40 and 60. Commerical DV-cameras recorded the procedure; the interpretation of films was accomplished manually, using a computer display.
The data shows a continuous change of time gaps, speed, density and finally personnel flow in the bottleneck. Furthermore transient phenomenon could be observed. Additionally, screening the video recordings a zipper effect is visible; this means, the persons optimize the density by themselves (see also 4).
In summary the experiment's most important result is the awareness of continuous rise in density, a step by step effect can not be observed- although this is a very popular consideration which can be found even in the German building regulations.},

However, these predictions have remained unverified because escape panic experiments with real systems are difficult to perform. For mice escaping out of a water pool, we found that for a critical sampling rate the escape behavior exhibits the predicted features even at short observation times. The mice escaped via an exit in bursts of different sizes that obey exponential and (truncated) power-law distributions depending on exit width. Oversampling or undersampling the mouse escape rate prevents the observation of the predicted features. Real systems are normally subject to unavoidable constraints arising from occupancy rate, pedestrian exhaustion, and nonrigidity of pedestrian bodies. The effect of these constraints on the dynamics of real escape panic is also studied.},

in the presence of anthropomorphic and inanimate objects. Precisely,
the results showed a decrease of walking speed as well as
an increase of the clearance distance (i. e., the minimal distance between
the walker and the obstacle) when facing virtual obstacles
compared to real ones. Moreover, our results suggest that users
act differently due to their perception of the obstacle: users keep
more distance when the obstacle is anthropomorphic compared to
an inanimate object and when the orientation of anthropomorphic
obstacle is from the profile compared to a front position. We discuss
implications on future large shared immersive projection spaces.},

 abstract = {Cellular automata models have been extensively used for simulating pedestrian movements. One weakness of this type of models, is the size of the cells which is mostly considered to be of the size of a pedestrian (i.e. 40cm*40cm or near to it). Each pedestrian stands in a single cell and during simulation time steps, transits to neighbouring cells. The size of the cells dictates discrete speed steps for pedestrians and chess like movements. A pedestrian could move one or more cells in a simulation time step or do not move at all. In order to have more smooth movement and different speeds for pedestrians (i.e. from different ages, physical and health status) we propose a finer grid cellular automata. We use this model to build a least effort cellular automata movement algorithm. The algorithm has been used in small scale movement layer of our multi-agent crowd simulation platform in order to allow more realistic simulations of crowd flows. A simple walkway scenario has been used to test the outcome of the model. Results of the simulation are reported in this paper.},

Alternatively, other factors, e.g., facilitation in early visual processing or in response selection, may play a role as well. In a contextual cueing experiment, participant's electrophysiological brain activity was recorded. Participants identified the target faster and more accurately in repeatedly presented displays. In this condition, the N2pc, a component reflecting the allocation of visual-spatial attention, was enhanced, indicating that attention was allocated more efficiently to those targets. However, also response-related processes, reflected by the LRP, were facilitated, indicating that guidance of attention cannot account for the entire contextual cueing benefit.},

Therefore, it is useful to reproduce passengers'  behavior inside trains. However, there is surprisingly little research on the subject. Do passengers distribute evenly as it is most often assumed in simulation models and as one would expect from a system that obeys the laws of thermodynamics? Conversely, is there a higher degree of order? To answer these questions, we collect data on seating behavior in Munich's suburban trains and analyze it. Clear preferences are revealed that contradict the former assumption of a uniform distribution. We subsequently introduce a model that matches the probability distributions we observed. We demonstrate the applicability of our model and present a qualitative validation with a simulation example. The model's implementation is part of the free and open-source Vadere simulation framework for pedestrian dynamics and thus available for further studies.

Zu den Erweiterungen zaehlen die autonome Umge-bungsanalyse und die Routenplanung des Agenten, die Abbildung weitreichender Wech-selwirkungen zwischen den Agenten und die Beruecksichtigung von gruppendynamischenEntscheidungen. Durch die Validierung des stochastischen Bewegungsmodells anhand desFundamentaldiagramms fuer Fussgaenger kann gezeigt werden, dass das Modell in der La-ge ist, den charakteristischen Verlauf der Geschwindigkeit in Relation zur Agentendichtequantitativ abzubilden. Auch typische, in der Realitaet beobachtbare Selbstorganisations-effekte konnen durch das Modell reproduziert werden.Fuer die Anwendung des stochastischen Modells zur Abbildung des Bewegungsverhal-tens von Passagieren im Flughafenterminal wird das Modell durch empirisch erhobenePassagierbewegungsdaten kalibriert. Die Datenerhebung erfolgt am Flughafen Dresdenunter Verwendung eines entwickelten videogestuetzten Bewegungsverfolgungssystems underlaubt eine gezielte Kalibrierung hinsichtlich der Passagierparameter: Geschlecht, Reise-motivation (privat oder geschaeftlich), Gruppengrosse sowie Gepaeckart und -anzahl. Fuerdie Erstellung der virtuellen Terminalumgebung werden die Passagierabfertigungsprozes-se eingehend analysiert und die Prozesszeiten der jeweiligen Abfertigungsstationen durchspezifische Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen modelliert. Hierfuer stehen empirische Date-nerhebungen am Flughafen Stuttgart zur Verfuegung, die eine detaillierte Prozessanalysehinsichtlich der Passagierparameter und der Prozessparameter (Erfahrung des Personals,Reaktionszeiten bei Storungen) erlauben.Im Anschluss an die Kalibrierung des stochastischen Bewegungsmodells und die Model-lierung der Passagierabfertigungsprozesse erfolgt die Entwicklung einer Anwendungsum-gebung fuer die Implementierung des virtuellen Flughafens.

 abstract = {With the continuous growth of cities and the issues of insufficient space, indoor parking garages have become a vital component of transportation systems. Since emergencies will occur sooner or later, planning and organizing a successful evacuation plan for parking garages, with the aim of reducing the evacuation time and improving the driver's behavior during evacuations, is needed. This research presents a systematic approach for the development and evaluation of evacuation strategies in such environments, through state-of-the-art sensitivity analysis that provides faster convergence and lower computational burden. To demonstrate the proposed methodology, a simulation model is developed using AIMSUN for a three-level indoor parking garage located in Athens, Greece. Four scenarios with different evacuation strategies and plans are considered. A multi-step sensitivity analysis framework is implemented to overcome the uncertainties that emerge from the model assumptions, model inaccuracy and shortage of data. Sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the consequences of the proposed scenarios and estimate the total time to evacuate the parking garage. The full experimental design resulted in the automated execution of more than 80 thousand simulations, corresponding to approximately 65 processor-days. The results of this research show that the developed methodology provides significant reduction in evacuation time (from 35% to over 40%). This process provides useful and credible ranges of expected evacuation times under all plausible outcomes.},

  abstract  = {India has witnessed higher level of mobility at urban as well as intercity segments due to improvisation of socio-economic conditions in last two decades. Even though, majority of the intercity travel is made by road based modes, number of passengers traveling by railways is significant on certain highly industrialized corridors. Collection and dispersal of passengers on railway platforms take place through stairways and foot over bridges. Design of these vital elements needs to incorporate the behavior of pedestrian flow to ensure desired level of service as well as safety in case of emergency. As reported in literature, pedestrian flow characteristics are influenced by number of attributes of pedestrian like age, gender, physical dimensions, luggage carried, group size, activity while walking, purpose in addition to the other attributes such as space availability, direction of movement and schedule of train as well. Very limited efforts are made in India to study pedestrian flow behavior in this context. Fluctuations in pedestrian flow depends on schedule of arrival and departure of the train, particularly during the peak hours as there is large passenger flow in short interval of time. Due to limited capacity of pedestrian facility, especially staircases, desired speed cannot be achieved by the pedestrian while walking in crowd with luggage. Higher walking speed is reported on downstairs than upstairs with reduction in speed with increase in pedestrian density. Most of the pedestrian facilities are designed by rule of thumb, especially stairways, largely governed by ideal pedestrian behavior. However behavior of individual pedestrian and hence flow at rail transit stations are dynamic on stairways depending on the factors mentioned above. Present study attempts to highlight the results of the study carried out on pedestrian flow behavior at Vadodara railway station in the state of Gujarat, India. Total 3411 number of pedestrian data are extracted by employing videographic technique. Flow models of speed- flow, speed-density and flow-density are developed to illustrate behaviour of pedestrian stream on stairways of different dimensions.},

 abstract = {The study of the discharge of active or self-driven matter in narrow passages has become of the growing interest in a variety of fields. The question has particularly important practical applications for the safety of pedestrian human flows notably in emergency scenarios. It has been suggested predominantly through simulation in some theoretical studies as well as through few experimentations that under certain circumstances, an elevated vigour to escape may exacerbate the outflow and cause further delay although the experimental evidence is rather mixed. The dimensions of this complex phenomenon known as the "faster-is slower" effect are of crucial importance to be understood owing to its potential practical implications for the emergency management. The contextual requirements of observing this phenomenon are yet to be identified. It is not clear whether a "do not speed up" policy is universally beneficial and advisable in an evacuation scenario. Here for the first time we experimentally examine this phenomenon in relation to the pedestrian flows at merging sections as a common geometric feature of crowd egress. Various merging angles and three different speed regimes were examined in high-density laboratory experiments. The measurements of flow interruptions and egress efficiency all indicated that the pedestrians were discharged faster when moving at elevated speed levels. We also observed clear dependencies between the discharge rate and the physical layout of the merging with certain designs clearly outperforming others. But regardless of the design, we observed faster throughput and greater avalanche sizes when we instructed pedestrians to run. Our results give the suggestion that observation of the faster-is-slower effect may necessitate certain critical conditions including passages being overly narrow relative to the size of participles (pedestrians) to create long-lasting blockages. The faster-is-slower assumption may not be universal and there may be circumstances where faster is, in fact, faster for evacuees. In the light of these findings, we suggest that it is important to identify and formulate those conditions so they can be disentangled from one another in the models. Misguided overgeneralisations may have unintended adverse ramifications for the safe evacuation management, and this highlights the need for further exploration of this phenomenon.},

 abstract = {Recent research suggests that sound appraisal can be moderated by social identity. We validate this finding, and also extend it, by examining the extent to which sound can also be understood as instrumental in intergroup relations. We interviewed nine members of a Catholic enclave in predominantly Protestant East Belfast about their experiences of an outgroup (Orange Order) parade, where intrusive sound was a feature. Participants reported experiencing the sounds as a manifestation of the Orange Order identity and said that it made them feel threatened and anxious because they felt it was targeted at them by the outgroup (e.g., through aggressive volume increases). There was also evidence that the sounds produced community disempowerment, which interviewees explicitly linked to the invasiveness of the music. Some interviewees described organizing to collectively drown out the bands sounds, an activity which appeared to be uplifting. These findings develop the elaborated social identity model of empowerment, by showing that intergroup struggle and collective self-objectification can operate through sound as well as through physical actions.},

During the design and operation stages, modeling of the metro station evacuation capacity by using the computational models is an effective measure for guaranteeing the metro evacuation safety in the future. In this article, the safety strategy of evacuation in metro stations is first investigated and established, which involves the occupants needed to be evacuated, the evacuation route, and the safety zone. Then, an engineering calculation method for the metro station evacuation time is proposed. Based on the experimental data, simulation of evacuation process in different fire cases is conducted by using an agent-based model, so as to study the features of occupant evacuation behavior, the evacuation time, the passage flow rate, and the strategy of using the escalator as evacuation passage. These conclusions will be helpful for guiding the safe evacuation design of metros in China.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a newly developed mesoscopic model with grid-based structure for building evacuation simulation. The evacuation space in this model is discretized into cells with larger size than that of the microscopic models. This mesoscopic model directly computes the density flow between the cells governed by the density flow algorithm. The computation speed is higher than the traditional cellular automata model in which the movements of all pedestrians should be tracked for calculating the crowd density. To test the feasibility of this model, we applied it to a typical scenario in which pedestrians evacuate from a square room with single exit and conducted parameter sensitivity study on the length of the time step ??. The simulation results show that, within a valid range, changing ?? only has minor influence on the evacuation process. We can directly identify area with high density as bottleneck from dynamically changed density map even the relatively large time step is adopted. In addition, the commercial package AnyLogic was used to benchmark the performance of this model. The results show that the mesoscopic model discerns evacuation patterns in more details compared to the macroscopic models and with higher efficiently computational speed than the microscopic models.},

The development of quantitative theories and models to explain and predict the collective dynamics of pedestrians has been hindered by the lack of complementary data under emergency conditions. Collective patterns are not restricted to humans, but have been observed in other non-human biological systems. In this study, a mathematical model for crowd panic is derived from collective animal dynamics. The development and validation of the model is supported by data from experiments with panicking Argentine ants (Linepithema humile). A first attempt is also made to scale the model parameters for collective pedestrian traffic from those for ant traffic, by employing a scaling concept approach commonly used in biology.},

@article{sieben-2017-cdyn,
 abstract = {This article is on collective phenomena in pedestrian dynamics during the assembling and dispersal of gatherings. To date pedestrian dynamics have been primarily studied in the natural and engineering sciences. Pedestrians are analyzed and modeled as driven particles revealing self-organizing phenomena and complex transport characteristics. However, pedestrians in crowds also behave as living beings according to stimulus-response mechanisms or act as human subjects on the basis of social norms, social identities or strategies. To show where pedestrian dynamics need social psychology in addition to the natural sciences we propose the application of three categories --- phenomena, behavior and action. They permit a clear discrimination between situations in which minimal models from the natural sciences are appropriate and those in which sociological and psychological concepts are needed. To demonstrate the necessity of this framework, an experiment in which a large group of people (n = 270) enters a concert hall through two different spatial barrier structures is analyzed. These two structures correspond to everyday situations such as boarding trains and access to immigration desks. Methods from the natural and social sciences are applied. Firstly, physical measurements show the influence of the spatial structure on the dynamics of the entrance procedure. Density, waiting time and speed of progress show large variations. Secondly, a questionnaire study (n = 60) reveals how people perceive and evaluate these entrance situations. Markedly different expectations, social norms and strategies are associated with the two spatial structures. The results from the questionnaire study do not always conform to objective physical measures, indicating the limitations of models which are based on objective physical measures alone and which neglect subjective perspectives.},

 abstract = {Fire regulations for buildings and architectural designs aimed at providing escape routes in case of fire, rest on unexamined assumptions. These are, briefly, that people 'panic' in fire and smoke and are therefore best kept in ignorance until the danger has been established that providing a variety of escape routes for use only in emergency will avert the surge to one entrance and the fight to escape through it. For shorthand this is called the panic concept or scenario. Evidence of real behaviour in fires does not support it. As will be shown, people appear to behave rationally in the light of the information they have. They also show marked preference for familiar routes and exits and concern for the safety of their family members. This is called the 'affiliation' model. Chapter 1 outlines the aims and structure of the thesis. Chapter 2 discusses the concept of panic and affiliative model. Chapter 3 reviews the existing research on escape behaviour in fires. Chapter 4 outlines the research strategy adopted: based on multivariate statistical analyses of categorical (frequency) data derived from interview accounts collected from fire survivors: Act sequence transitions, Multi-variate and Partial-Order Scalogram Analyses (MSA-1, POSA), Causal Loglinear Analysis (CLA). The analyses focus on Recognition of the fire threat, Role, Location, Group membership and Location, Direction of Movement. Chapter. 5 analyses the sequence of acts of 41 individuals in 14 domestic fires. Chapter 6 analyses the pattern and distance moved by 33 survivors of an hotel fire. Chapter 7 examines the exit choice behaviour by 75 people in the Marquee Showbar (MSB) (Summer-land Fire). Chapter 8 examines the pattern of affiliative behaviour of 128 people in the Solarium (Summerland). Chapter 9 analyses the outcome of escape behaviour for groups and individuals in the MSB and Solarium. In general, the affiliative model fits the results much more closely than the panic concept. Chapter 10 outlines the implications of the research, in particular the weakness in assuming people will use conventionally unfamiliar emergency escape routes.},

 abstract = {This paper argues that a comprehensive approach to crowd safety design, management and risk assessment needs to integrate psychology and engineering frames of reference. Psychology and engineering are characteristically mutually exclusive in their focus on the perspective of crowd rnembers who think and behat, e (psychology) or on static and dynamic objects (engineering). Engineering places as much emphasis on the physical environment as psychology negates the relationship between the physical environment and people. This paper stresses the need to address the relationship between (A) design and engineering (B) communications technology x(C) crowd managementx(D) crowd behaviour and movement. Theories of crowd psychology are briefly reviewed with particular reference to crowd ingress and egress and misconceptions about 'panic' or irrational behaviour. Assumptions about panic reinforce an emphasis on the control of a crowd, as if a crowd is a homogeneous mass of bodies or 'ballbearings', rather than the management of a crowd as a collection of individuals and social groups who need accurate and timely information if they are to remain sale. Particular emphasis is put on the fact that the time Ibr a crowd to escape from a sittlation of potential entrapment is a function of T ( Time to escape) = t~ ( time to start to move) + t2 ( time to move to and pass through exits), rather than T= t2. This is illustrated by reference to research of escape behaviour in the Summerland fire and underground station evacuations. The paper concludes by stressi.ng the need to validate computer simulations of crowd movement and escape behaviour against psychological as well as engineering criteria.},

  abstract     = {We use a simple traffic micro-simulation model based on queueing dynamics as introduced by Gawron [IJMPC, 9(3):393, 1998] in order to simulate traffic in Portland/Oregon. Links have a flow capacity, that is, they do not release more vehicles per second than is possible according to their capacity. This leads to queue built-up if demand exceeds capacity. Links also have a storage capacity, which means that once a link is full, vehicles that want to enter the link need to wait. This leads to queue spill-back through the network. The model is compatible with route-plan-based approaches such as TRANSIMS, where each vehicle attempts to follow its pre-computed path. Yet, both the data requirements and the computational requirements are considerably lower than for the full TRANSIMS microsimulation. Indeed, the model uses standard emme/2 network data, and runs about eight times faster than real time with more than 100 000 vehicles simultaneously in the simulation on a single Pentium-type CPU. We derive the model's fundamental diagrams and explain it. The simulation is used to simulate traffic on the emme/2 network of the Portland (Oregon) metropolitan region (20 000 links). Demand is generated by a simplified home-to-work destination assignment which generates about half a million trips for the morning peak. Route assignment is done by iterative feedback between micro-simulation and router. An iterative solution of the route assignment for the above problem can be achieved within about half a day of computing time on a desktop workstation. We compare results with field data and with results of traditional assignment runs by the Portland Metropolitan Planning Organization. Thus, with a model such as this one, it is possible to use a dynamic, activities-based approach to transportation simulation (such as in TRANSIMS) with affordable data and hardware. This should enable systematic research about the coupling of demand generation, route assignment, and micro-simulation output.},

In addition, techniques developed for crowd counting can be applied to related tasks in other fields of study such as cell microscopy, vehicle counting and environmental survey. The task of crowd counting and density map estimation is riddled with many challenges such as occlusions, non-uniform density, intra-scene and inter-scene variations in scale and perspective. Nevertheless, over the last few years, crowd count analysis has evolved from earlier methods that are often limited to small variations in crowd density and scales to the current state-of-the-art methods that have developed the ability to perform successfully on a wide range of scenarios. The success of crowd counting methods in the recent years can be largely attributed to deep learning and publications of challenging datasets. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approaches that have demonstrated significant improvements over earlier methods that rely largely on hand-crafted representations. First, we briefly review the pioneering methods that use hand-crafted representations and then we delve in detail into the deep learning-based approaches and recently published datasets. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and drawbacks of existing CNN-based approaches and identify promising avenues of research in this rapidly evolving field.},

 abstract = {Social scientists have criticised computer models of pedestrian streams for their treatment of psychological
crowds as mere aggregations of individuals. Indeed most models for evacuation dynamics use analogies
from physics where pedestrians are considered as particles. Although this ensures that the results of
the simulation match important physical phenomena, such as the deceleration of the crowd with
increasing density, social phenomena such as group processes are ignored. In particular, people in a
crowd have social identities and share those social identities with the others in the crowd. The process
of self categorisation determines norms within the crowd and influences how people will behave in
evacuation situations. We formulate the application of social identity in pedestrian simulation
algorithmically. The goal is to examine whether it is possible to carry over the psychological model to
computer models of pedestrian motion so that simulation results correspond to observations from crowd
psychology. That is, we quantify and formalise empirical research on and verbal descriptions of the effect
of group identity on behaviour. We use uncertainty quantification to analyse the model's behaviour when
we vary crucial model parameters. In this first approach we restrict ourselves to a specific scenario that
was thoroughly investigated by crowd psychologists and where some quantitative data is available: the
bombing and subsequent evacuation of a London underground tube carriage on July 7th 2005.},

 abstract = {All humans are unique, we have different characteristics and we make different decision. This is a challenge when it comes to modelling human behaviour. The models we design are based on mathematics where there is no room for inconsistencies such that are present in human behaviour. So how do we account for this when we try to model human behaviour in evacuation modelling? Most models provide the possibility to include mathematical distributions and 
algorithms that are supposed to represent this uncertainty that we refer to as behavioural uncertainty. This thesis aims at providing a method based on functional analysis and statistics that can be used to study the effects of behavioural uncertainty on evacuation simulation results and in particular to study convergence in results for important output parameters. Previous work has 
been done for the most important evacuation model output, namely the evacuation time. The work in this thesis contributes by including other output parameters which are of importance both for the evacuation time and other aspects of evacuation safety. The method is accompanied by a tool that helps the user in this kind of quantitative assessment. A demonstration of the method and the tool has been provided through the use of a case study. The results showed that the analysis is efficient in analysing convergence in results for a variety of output parameters, even for output parameters with varying number of data points. This enables a more comprehensive and detailed analysis than what has previously been shown, ensuring that the behaviours that govern evacuation time also have converged in results.},

 abstract = {Insects are able to navigate reliably between food and nest using only visual information. This behavior has inspired many models of visual landmark guidance, some of which have been tested on autonomous robots. The majority of these models work by comparing the agent's current view with a view of the world stored when the agent was at the goal. The region from which agents can successfully reach home is therefore limited to the goal's visual locale, that is, the area around the goal where the visual scene is not radically different to the goal position. Ants are known to navigate over large distances using visually guided routes consisting of a series of visual memories. Taking inspiration from such route navigation, we propose a framework for linking together local navigation methods. We implement this framework on a robotic platform and test it in a series of environments in which local navigation methods fail. Finally, we show that the framework is robust to environments of varying complexity.},

 abstract = {Investigated systematic retrospective distortions of past events precipitated by one's current beliefs about another individual. 212 undergraduates read an extensive narrative about the life of a woman named Betty K. Either immediately after reading the case history or 1 wk later, some participants learned that she was currently living a lesbian life-style; others learned that she was currently living a heterosexual life-style; still others learned nothing about her life-style. The impact of this new information on recognition memory for factual events in Betty K.'s life was assessed 1 wk after reading the case history. Ss selectively affirmed events that supported and bolstered their current interpretations of Betty K. Performance was the same whether Ss learned this information immediately after reading the case history or 1 wk later. Additional evidence suggests that these results are best characterized as the product of an interaction between stereotyped beliefs about sexuality and genuine memory for factual events. Implications of these findings for the nature, function, and consequences of social knowledge are discussed},

 abstract = {Ideally, a multitude of steps has to be taken before a commercial implementation of a pedestrian model is used in practice.
Calibration, the main goal of which is to increase the accuracy of the predictions by determining the set of values for the model
parameters that allows for the best replication of reality, has an important role in this process. Yet, up to recently, calibration has
received relatively little attention within the field of pedestrian modelling. Most studies focus only on one specific movement base
case and/or use a singlemetric. It is questionable how generally applicable a pedestrian simulationmodel is that has been calibrated
using a limited set of movement base cases and one metric. The objective of this research is twofold, namely, to (1) determine the
effect of the choice of movement base cases, metrics, and density levels on the calibration results and (2) to develop a multipleobjective
calibration approach to determine the aforementioned effects. In this paper a multiple-objective calibration scheme is
presented for pedestrian simulation models, in which multiple normalized metrics (i.e., flow, spatial distribution, effort, and travel
time) are combined by means of weighted sum method that accounts for the stochastic nature of themodel. Based on the analysis of
the calibration results, it can be concluded that (1) it is necessary to use multiple movement base cases when calibrating a model to
capture all relevant behaviours, (2) the level of density influences the calibration results, and (3) the choice ofmetric or combinations
of metrics influence the results severely.},

 abstract = {Severe accidents with many fatalities have occurred when too many pedestrians had to maneuver in too tight surroundings, as during evacuations of mass events. This demonstrates the importance of a better general understanding of pedestrians and emergent complex behavior in crowds. To this end, we develop both a new microscopic agent-based pedestrian model and also study simplified evacuation scenarios which permit the isolation of relevant nonlinear effects and their systematic investigation. We concentrate on two effects: First, the influence of the position and size of an obstacle in front of an emergency exit on the flux through the exit, and second, the influence of other pedestrians on the route choice of an individual. The first investigation demonstrates the possibility of improving substantially the flow through an exit by placing an obstacle in a suitable way in front of it. The latter shows clearly bistable states and hysteresis effects, indicating the existence of unstable pedestrian flow states in addition to the stable states. Furthermore, this set-up is an example of a radical change of the pedestrian flux by only a small change in the geometry of the evacuation scenario. The results motivate further investigation and eventually engineering use by optimizing the design of large buildings, stations, airports and stadiums for mass events.},

 abstract = {For the planning of large pedestrian facilities, the movement of pedestrians in various situations has to be modelled. Many tools for pedestrian planning are based on cellular automata (CA), discrete in space and time, some use self driven pargticles (SDP), continuous in space and time. It is common experience that CA have problems with modelling sharp bends in wide corridors. They tend to move the pedestrians to the innermost lanes far too strongly, thereby reducing the capacity of the facility. With SDP, the problem seems to be less pronounced but still present. With CA, we compare the performance of two standard shortest distance based static floors on 90 and 180 degree bends with a newly defined one. For SDP, we demonstrate how variations in the modeling of the momentary destination of the agents influence trajectories and capacity.},

 abstract = {One major business of civil aviation is to carry passengers between airports while providing
good customer services at low costs. The turn time of an airplane, i.e. broadly speaking, the
time that an airplane is on ground, is crucial for its utilisation and thus for the airlines profitability.
From this it follows, that the turn time needs to be as short as possible.
In this paper we analyse various actions (inside and outside the airplane) to reduce the boarding
time and hence the turn time. These actions were investigated with a specifically developed
simulation tool (the Airplane Boarding Simulator (ABS)), and cover the whole process from
(and including) the gate until the passengers arrive at their seats.
The simulation model was calibrated by using video data from observations of eight boardings
at Zurich airport. The primary goal was to determine the impact of the following factors on the
boarding time: (i) number of pieces of hand luggage, (ii) pre-boarding area (and timing), (iii)
boarding (seating) strategy inside the airplane, (iv) procedures at the gate desk (power-boarding,
additional staff).
Based on the experiences on-site and the results of the simulations we found, that with a reduced
number of pieces of hand luggage, the use of a pre-boarding area and an appropriate
boarding (seating) strategy, a reduction of the boarding time of around four minutes for airplanes
of similar size than the Airbus A321 is possible. Moreover, we outline feasible actions
that could lead to further improvements. In any case, a good coordination of the actions taken is
of crucial importance, together with an appropriate training of the staff (airplane crew and
ground) and a clear and easy to understand information of the passengers.},

@article{stephan-1952-cdyn,
 abstract = {In contemporary sociological and social psychological theory and research an increasing amount of attention has been  given to the functioning of small groups.' Many attempts have been made to analyze the interaction that takes place in small group meetings and to discover general principles that appear to determine, or at least influence, the pattern of participation by the  various members of the group. The research reported here is devoted to one of the basic aspects of small group research, namely the relative frequency of participation. Specifically, this study concerns the application of a relatively simple mathematical function that appears to express quite well the distribution of participation within a particular type of small discussion group. In a recent paper, Bales suggested that a harmonic distribution might serve to approximate the relative frequency of acts of participation among members of small problem- solving groups. The results he obtained, however, indicated that this approximation is not close enough to be fully satisfactory and, for this reason, he concluded that a more complicated model may be necessary for greater precision. The proven inadequacy of the harmonic model, however, does not necessitate the use of models of great complexity. A model of comparable simplicity is available which appears to provide a very good representation of data obtained from a variety of small discussion groups. It is a simple exponential model, that had previously been applied by one of the authors to another study of group participation. When it was applied to Bales' published data, it provided a good fit.4 This paper is primarily  concerned with the general adequacy of this exponential model for representing other sets of participation  data.},

This was investigated in five ticket halls in the London Underground. Queues, groups of people using automatic ticket machines, and other types of static groups were observed. The location of these groups was related to the layout of the space, and their general effects on movement through the space were assessed. It was found that under certain conditions static groups impede movement and diminish the effective width of key movoment channels. Although the study was exploratory, the results suggest a number of ways in which the layout of certain types of space might be optimized in terms of the criteria considered.},

  abstract = {The question of how normative form changes during a riot, and thus how collective behaviour spreads to different targets and locations, has been neglected in previous research, despite its theoretical and practical importance. We begin to address this limitation through a detailed analysis of the rioting in the London borough of Haringey in 2011. 
A triangulated analysis of multiple sources of data (including police reports, media accounts, and videos) finds a pattern of behaviour shifting from collective attacks on police targets to looting. 
A thematic analysis of 41 interview accounts with participants gathered shortly after the events suggests that a shared anti-police identity allowed local postcode rivalries to be overcome, forming the basis of empowered action not only against the police but to address more long-standing grievances and desires. 
It is argued that collective psychological empowerment operated in a positive feedback loop, whereby one form of collective self-objectification (and perceived inability of police to respond) formed the basis of further action. This analysis of the development of new targets in an empowered crowd both confirms and extends the elaborated social identity model as an explanation for conflictual intergroup dynamics.},

  abstract = {Social transmission of information is vital for many group-living animals, allowing coordination of motion and effective response to complex environments. Revealing the interaction networks underlying information flow within these groups is a central challenge [1]. Previous work has modeled interactions between individuals based directly on their relative spatial positions: each individual is considered to interact with all neighbors within a fixed distance (metric range [2]), a fixed number of nearest neighbors (topological range [3]), a 'shell' of near neighbors (Voronoi range [4]), or some combination (Figure 1A). However, conclusive evidence to support these assumptions is lacking. Here, we employ a novel approach that considers individual movement decisions to be based explicitly on the sensory information available to the organism. In other words, we consider that while spatial relations do inform interactions between individuals, they do so indirectly, through individuals' detection of sensory cues. We reconstruct computationally the visual field of each individual throughout experiments designed to investigate information propagation within fish schools (golden shiners, Notemigonus crysoleucas). Explicitly considering visual sensing allows us to more accurately predict the propagation of behavioral change in these groups during leadership events. Furthermore, we find that structural properties of visual interaction networks differ markedly from those of metric and topological counterparts, suggesting that previous assumptions may not appropriately reflect information flow in animal groups.},

 abstract = {Pedestrian dynamics are affected by several factors including pedestrian compositions. In this article, we examine the movement characteristics of Palestinian pedestrians using the fundamental diagram for single-file movement experiments conducted with an emphasis on gender compositions. Our findings show that the mean velocity of exclusively male pedestrians is approximately the same as exclusively female pedestrians. 
For instance, when the number of pedestrians is 20, the velocities for male and female are 0.72 +- 0.10 ms -1 and 0.71 +- 0.11 ms -1 , respectively, whereas their velocity decreases gradually if they walk in mixed groups with an average velocity of 0.61 +- 0.11 ms -1 . 
We also compare our findings with other culture-based experiments to demonstrate that pedestrian cultures have an effect on their movement characteristics. Moreover, we demonstrate that age is another factor that affects pedestrians' movement. A comparative analysis is performed between Palestinian and Chinese experiments for this purpose. Our results confirm that for relatively high densities older Chinese pedestrians walk faster than young Palestinians in groups of mixed gender.},

@article{sumpter-2006-cdyn,
 abstract = {In recent years, the concept of self-organization has been used to understand collective behaviour of animals. The central tenet of self-organization is that simple repeated interactions between individuals can produce complex adaptive patterns at the level of the group. Inspiration comes from patterns seen in physical systems, such as spiralling chemical waves, which arise without complexity at the level of the individual units of which the system is composed. The suggestion is that biological structures such as termite mounds, ant trail networks and even human crowds can be explained in terms of repeated interactions between the animals and their environment, without invoking individual complexity. Here, I review cases in which the self-organization approach has been successful in explaining collective behaviour of animal groups and societies. Ant pheromone trail networks, aggregation of cockroaches, the applause of opera audiences and the migration of fish schools have all been accurately described in terms of individuals following simple sets of rules. Unlike the simple units composing physical systems, however, animals are themselves complex entities, and other examples of collective behaviour, such as honey bee foraging with its myriad of dance signals and behavioural cues, cannot be fully understood in terms of simple individuals alone. I argue that the key to understanding collective behaviour lies in identifying the principles of the behavioural algorithms followed by individual animals and of how information flows between the animals. These principles, such as positive feedback, response thresholds and individual integrity, are repeatedly observed in very different animal societies. The future of collective behaviour research lies in classifying these principles, establishing the properties they produce at a group level and asking why they have evolved in so many different and distinct natural systems. Ultimately, this research could inform not only our understanding of animal societies, but also the principles by which we organize our own society.},

between individual particles and between particle and elements of construction. Current needs of both technology and science call for the new research

Traditional motion planners for mobile ground robots with a laser range sensor mostly depend on the obstacle map of the navigation environment where both the highly precise laser sensor and the obstacle map building work of the environment are indispensable. We show that, through an asynchronous deep reinforcement learning method, a mapless motion planner can be trained end-to-end without any manually designed features and prior demonstrations. The trained planner can be directly applied in unseen virtual and real environments. The experiments show that the proposed mapless motion planner can navigate the nonholonomic mobile robot to the desired targets without colliding with any obstacles.},

However, most agent architectures in these simulations use simple reactive models. Indeed, cognitive agent architectures face two main obstacles: their complexity for the field-expert modeler, and their computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new cognitive agent architecture based on the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) paradigm integrated into the GAMA modeling platform and its GAML modeling language. This architecture was designed to be simple-to-use for modelers, flexible enough to manage complex behaviors, and with low computational cost. An experiment carried out with different profiles of end-users shows that the architecture is actually usable even by modelers who have little knowledge in programming and in Artificial Intelligence.},

 abstract = {The agent-based modeling approach is now used in many domains such as geography, ecology, or
economy, and more generally to study (spatially explicit) socio-environmental systems where the
heterogeneity of the actors and the numerous feedback loops between them requires amodular and
incremental approach to modeling. One major reason of this success, besides this conceptual
facility, can be found in the support provided by the development of increasingly powerful
software platforms, which now allow modelers without a strong background in computer science
to easily and quickly develop their own models. Another trend observed in the latest years is the
development of much more descriptive and detailed models able not only to better represent
complex systems, but also answer more intricate questions. In that respect, if all agent-based
modeling platforms support the design of small to mid-size models, i.e. models with little
heterogeneity between agents, simple representation of the environment, simple agent decisionmaking
processes, etc., very few are adapted to the design of large-scale models. GAMA is one of
the latter. It has been designed with the aim of supporting the writing (and composing) of fairly
complex models, with a strong support of the spatial dimension, while guaranteeing non-computer
scientists an easy access to high-level, otherwise complex, operations. This paper presents GAMA
1.8, the latest revision to date of the platform, with a focus on its modeling language and its
capabilities to manage the spatial dimension of models. The capabilities of GAMA are illustrated
by the presentation of applications that take advantage of its new features.},

 abstract = {We present a pedestrian movement model, which use a multi agents system for pedestrian traffic analysis. The model captures the dynamic microscopic interaction between pedestrians, which cannot be addressed using traditional macroscopic approach. The pedestrians are modeled as autonomous agents with non-linear system differential equations. The pedestrian agents may avoid other pedestrians, passing and overtaking slower pedestrians and to form a self-organization behavior of lane formations as in real pedestrian studies. A critical issue for such multi-agent pedestrian models, however, is the validation of the model against real world data. We show that the sensitivity analysis of control variables and parameters of the multi-agents model form the basis in ensuring the validation step. The model was automatically validated using real world data by minimizing the difference between the speed distributions. With the validated model, we can utilize model applications to evaluate pedestrian facilities.},

The purpose of this paper is to provide an insight regarding the possible application of the microscopic pedestrian model. The microscopic pedestrian model was developed and the microscopic pedestrian data validated it. Although the model is very simple, it shows the lane formation, self-organization phenomena as seen in the real world. Three microscopic simulation scenarios were developed. The first scenario compares one-way and two-way pedestrian traffic to gain more understanding about their characteristics. The second scenario is to know the behavior of the system if the number of elderly pedestrian increases. The third scenario proposes a policy of lane-like segregation towards pedestrian crossing and inspects the performance of the crossing.},

If the number of occupants in the building is only small, then the shortest paths to the exits may enable all the occupants to evacuate in minimum possible time. Previous studies have shown, however, that the shortest path configuration does not lead to minimum egress time for large crowds in public facilities such as those in a school, theater or gym. We extend the previous studies by determining the minimum egress time for different crowd sizes on a fixed network graph. We apply optimization search on a mesoscopic multi-agent pedestrian simulation that employs the concept of Route-Choice Self-Organization (RCSO). We show that the egress time gap between the shortest path configuration and RCSO configuration increases very quickly with respect to crowd size. Thus, for crowded pedestrian facilities, there may be a need to revise the standard evacuation map so that evacuation behavior that approximates the RCSO becomes possible, and this can lead to a much better egress time.},

We critically examine the crowd modeling literature and call for future simulations of crowd behavior to be based more closely on findings from current social psychological research. A systematic review was conducted on the crowd modeling literature (N = 140 articles) to identify the assumptions about crowd behavior that modelers use in their simulations. Articles were coded according to the way in which crowd structure was modeled. It was found that 2 broad types are used: mass approaches and small group approaches. However, neither the mass nor the small group approaches can accurately simulate the large collective behavior that has been found in extensive empirical research on crowd events. We argue that to model crowd behavior realistically, simulations must use methods which allow crowd members to identify with each other, as suggested by self-categorization theory.},

investigated the behavioural effects that a shared social
identity has on crowd movement at a pedestrian level. To
investigate the direction and extent to which social identity
influences the movement of crowds, 280 trajectories were
tracked as participants walked in one of two conditions:
(1) a psychological crowd primed to share a social identity;
(2) a naturally occurring physical crowd. Behaviour
was compared both within and between the conditions.
In comparison to the physical crowd, members of the
psychological crowd (i) walked slower, (ii) walked further, and
(iii) maintained closer proximity. In addition, pedestrians who
had to manoeuvre around the psychological crowd behaved
differently to pedestrians who had to manoeuvre past the
naturally occurring crowd. We conclude that the behavioural
differences between physical and psychological crowds must
be taken into account when considering crowd behaviour in
event safety management and computer models of crowds.},

how the presence of large groups with different social identities can affect pedestrian

groups and primed to have identities as either team A or team B. The trajectories of
all participants were tracked to compare the movement of team A when walking alone to
when walking in counterflow with team B, based on their i) speed of movement and distance
walked, and ii) proximity between participants. In comparison to walking alone, the
presence of another group influenced team A to collectively self-organise to reduce their
speed and distance walked in order to walk closely together with ingroup members. We
discuss the importance of incorporating social identities into pedestrian group dynamics

A navigation mesh is a data structure that allows efficient path planning. The Explicit Corridor Map (ECM) is a navigation mesh based on the medial axis. It enables path planning for disk-shaped characters of any radius.
In this paper, we formally extend the medial axis (and therefore the ECM) to 3D environments in which characters are constrained to walkable surfaces. Typical examples of such environments are multi-storey buildings, train stations, and sports stadiums. We give improved definitions of a walkable environment (WE: a description of walkable surfaces in 3D) and a multi-layered environment (MLE: a subdivision of a WE into connected layers). We define the medial axis of such environments based on projected distances on the ground plane. For an MLE with n boundary vertices and k connections, we show that the medial axis has size O(n), and we present an improved algorithm that constructs the medial axis in O(nlognlogk) time.
The medial axis can be annotated with nearest-obstacle information to obtain the ECM navigation mesh. Our implementations show that the ECM can be computed efficiently for large 2D and multi-layered environments, and that it can be used to compute paths within milliseconds. This enables simulations of large virtual crowds of heterogeneous characters in real-time.},

 abstract = {The propagation speed of a starting wave, which is a wave of peoples successive reactions in the relaxation process of a queue, has an essential role for pedestrians and vehicles to achieve smooth movement. For example, a queue of vehicles with appropriate headway (or density) alleviates traffic jams since the delay of reaction to start is minimized. In this paper, we have investigated the fundamental relation between the propagation speed of a starting wave and the initial density by both our mathematical model built on the stochastic cellular automata and experimental measurements. Analysis of our mathematical model implies that the relation is characterized by a power law and the experimental results verify this feature. Moreover, when the starting wave is characterized by the power law we have revealed the existence of optimal density, where the required time, i.e., the sum of the waiting time until the starting wave reaches the last pedestrian in a queue and his/her travel time to pass the head position of the initial queue, is minimized. This optimal density inevitably plays a significant role in achieving a smooth movement of crowds and vehicles in a queue.},

 comment = {<note author="gk"> Seems to be a basois paper of the papers on queuing models using exclusive queuing processes or totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes and such. The paper investigates the propagation speed of pedestrians reactions in the relaxation process of a queue, the so-called starting wave, toward a smooth movement of crowds since a fast starting wave achieves a high departure rate. The authors propose a mathematical model, a stochastic cellular automaton models with a headway-dependent hopping prob- ability. A special relation between the propagation speed of pedestrians reactions and the initial density is found, which is well approximated by a power law that contains the arrival rate and the service rate and the density.

The model builds on a stochastic process, describing transition rates among adjacent sites on a lattice. Each lattice can contain several pedestrians. The approach is minimal and fast to simulate, and, by construction, capable of capturing population heterogeneity as well as variability in walking behaviour and en-route path choice. The model is more efficient than microscopic models, and potentially more accurate than macroscopic ones. We calibrate and validate the model using real data and carry out several numerical experiments to present its key properties and possible applications for simulation of large-scale scenarios.},

instance, can exceed the maximal rates observed in straight corridors. Consequently, accurate
predictions of pedestrians movements in complex buildings including corridors, corners,
bottlenecks, or intersections are difficult tasks for minimal models with a single setting of
the parameters. Artificial neural networks are robust algorithms able to identify various
types of patterns. In this paper, we will investigate their suitability for forecasting of pedestrian
dynamics in complex architectures. Therefore, we develop, train, and test several artificial
neural networks for predictions of pedestrian speeds in corridor and bottleneck
experiments. The estimations are compared with those of a classical speed-based model.
The results show that the neural networks can distinguish the two facilities and significantly
improve the prediction of pedestrian speeds.},

 abstract = {Human movement is a significant ingredient of many social, environmental, and technical systems, yet the importance of movement is often discounted in considering systems' complexity. Movement is commonly abstracted in agent-based modeling (which is perhaps the methodological vehicle for modeling complex systems), despite the influence of movement upon information exchange and adaptation in a system. In particular, agent-based models of urban pedestrians often treat movement in proxy form at the expense of faithfully treating movement behavior with realistic agency. There exists little consensus about which method is appropriate for representing movement in agent-based schemes. In this paper, we examine popularly-used methods to drive movement in agent-based models, first by introducing a methodology that can flexibly handle many representations of movement at many different scales and second, introducing a suite of tools to benchmark agent movement between models and against real-world trajectory data. We find that most popular movement schemes do a relatively poor job of representing movement, but that some schemes may well be ``good enough'' for some applications. We also discuss potential avenues for improving the representation of movement in agent-based frameworks.},

 abstract = {Gibson's ecological theory of perception has received considerable attention within psychology literature, as well as in computer vision and robotics. However, few have applied Gibson's approach to agent-based models of human movement, because the ecological theory requires that individuals have a vision-based mental model of the world, and for large numbers of agents this becomes extremely expensive computationally. Thus, within current pedestrian models, path evaluation is based on calibration from observed data or on sophisticated but deterministic route-choice mechanisms; there is little open-ended behavioural modelling of human-movement patterns. One solution which allows individuals rapid concurrent access to the visual information within an environment is an 'exosomatic visual architecture', where the connections between mutually visible locations within a configuration are prestored in a lookup table. Here we demonstrate that, with the aid of an exosomatic visual architecture, it is possible to develop behavioural models in which movement rules originating from Gibson's principle of affordance are utilised. We apply large numbers of agents programmed with these rules to a built-environment example and show that, by varying parameters such as destination selection, field of view, and steps taken between decision points, it is possible to generate aggregate movement levels very similar to those found in an actual building context.},

An agent-based crowd evacuation simulation model was created, named IMPACT, to study the evacuation process from a transport hub. To extend previous research, various socio-cultural, cognitive, and emotional factors were modelled, including: language, gender, familiarity with the environment, emotional contagion, prosocial behaviour, falls, group decision making, and compliance. The IMPACT model was validated against data from an evacuation drill using the existing EXODUS evacuation model. Results show that on all measures, the IMPACT model is within or close to the prescribed boundaries, thereby establishing its validity. Structured simulations with the validated model revealed important findings, including: the effect of doors as bottlenecks, social contagion speeding up evacuation time, falling behaviour not affecting evacuation time significantly, and travelling in groups being more beneficial for evacuation time than travelling alone. This research has important practical applications for crowd management professionals, including transport hub operators, first responders, and risk assessors.},

A floor field is defined so that moving to a cell with lower floor field means approaching an exit door. The model becomes non-deterministic by introducing a "panic" parameter, given by a probability of not moving, and by a random choice to resolve conflicts in the update of pedestrian positions. Two types of exit doors are considered: single (where only one person can pass) and double (two persons can pass simultaneously). For a double door, the longest evacuation time turns out to occur for a very traditional location of the door. The optimum door position is determined. Replacing the double door by two single doors does not improve evacuation times noticeably. On the other hand, for a room without obstacles, a simple scaling law is proposed to model the dependence of evacuation time with the number of persons and exit width. This model fails when obstacles are present, as their presence introduces local bottlenecks whose effect outweighs the benefits of increasing door width beyond a certain threshold.},

 abstract = {Crowd simulation is rapidly becoming a standard tool for evacuation planning and evaluation. However, the many crowd models in the literature are structurally different, and few have been rigorously calibrated against real-world egress data, especially in emergency situations. In this paper we describe a procedure to quantitatively compare different crowd models or between models and real-world data. We simulated three models: (1) the lattice gas model, (2) the social force model, and (3) the RVO2 model, and obtained the distributions of six observables: (1) evacuation time, (2) zoned evacuation time, (3) passage density, (4) total distance traveled, (5) inconvenience, and (6) flow rate. We then used the DISTATIS procedure to compute the compromise matrix of statistical distances between the three models. Projecting the three models onto the first two principal components of the compromise matrix, we find the lattice gas and RVO2 models are similar in terms of the evacuation time, passage density, and flow rates, whereas the social force and RVO2 models are similar in terms of the total distance traveled. Most importantly, we find that the zoned evacuation times of the three models to be very different from each other. Thus we propose to use this variable, if it can be measured, as the key test between different models, and also between models and the real world. Finally, we compared the model flow rates against the flow rate of an emergency evacuation during the May 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and found the social force model agrees best with this real data.},

The experiments have been performed with pupils of different ages. Parameters that have been considered are (1) group size, (2) strength of intra-group interactions, and (3) composition of the groups (young adults, children, and mixtures). For all the experiments high-quality trajectories for all participants have been obtained using the PeTrack software. This allows for a detailed analysis of the group effects.

 abstract = {The choice of the exit to egress from a facility plays a fundamental role in pedestrian modelling and simulation. Yet, empirical evidence for backing up simulation is scarce. In this contribution, we present three new groups of experiments that we conducted in different geometries. We varied parameters such as the width of the doors, the initial location and number of pedestrians which in turn affected their perception of the environment. We extracted and analysed relevant indicators such as distance to the exits and density levels. The results put in evidence the fact that pedestrians use time-dependent information to optimize their exit choice, and that, in congested states, a load balancing over the exits occurs. We propose a minimal modelling approach that covers those situations, especially the cases where the geometry does not show a symmetrical configuration. Most of the models try to achieve the load balancing by simulating the system and solving optimization problems. We show statistically and by simulation that a linear model based on the distance to the exits and the density levels around the exit can be an efficient dynamical alternative.},

To determine whether a pedestrian would stop for visual attractors, factors of attractors attractiveness, distance to the attractor as well as the visibility of the attractor from current location of the agent are considered. By analyzing the parameters in this model, we have successfully revealed different pedestrian movement modes, attractor preferences and movement trajectories in a notional setting. The reliability of the model is then demonstrated with a simulation scenario targeting at a circulation region of a shopping mall in Hong Kong. Observational data is used for model input and the number changes of attracted pedestrians in front of a major attractor are compared between simulation results and empirical video data. Results from the parameter analysis and simulation scenario show that the model is flexible and can benefit in real applications such as shop arrangement as well as street furniture placement.},

 abstract = {Stepping locomotion is the basis of human
movement. The investigation of stepping locomotion and its affecting
factors is necessary for a more realistic knowledge of human movement,
which is usually referred to as walking with equal step lengths for the
right and left leg. To study pedestrians'stepping locomotion, a set
of single-file movement experiments involving 39 participants of the
same age walking on a highly curved oval course is conducted. The
microscopic characteristics of the pedestrians including 1D Voronoi
density, speed, and step length are calculated based on a projected
coordinate. The influence of the projection lines with different radii
on the measurement of these quantities is investigated. The step lengths
from the straight and curved parts are compared using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. During the experiments, six different step
styles are observed and the proportions of different step styles change
with the density. At low density, the main step style is the
stable-large step style and the step lengths of one pedestrian are
almost constant. At high density, some pedestrians adjust and decrease
their step lengths. Some pedestrians take relatively smaller and larger
steps alternately to adapt to limited space.},

To relate characteristics of human locomotor system with properties of human traffic flow, this paper aims to connect gait characteristics like step length, step frequency, swaying amplitude and synchronization with speed and density and thus to build a ground for advanced pedestrian models. For this aim, observational and experimental study on the single-file movement of pedestrians at different densities is conducted. Methods to measure step length, step frequency, swaying amplitude and step synchronization are proposed by means of trajectories of the head. Mathematical models for the relations of step length or frequency and speed are evaluated. The problem how step length and step duration are influenced by factors like body height and density is investigated. It is shown that the effect of body height on step length and step duration changes with density. Furthermore, two different types of step in-phase synchronization between two successive pedestrians are observed and the influence of step synchronization on step length is examined.},

  abstract = {Numerical models indicate that collective animal behavior may emerge from simple local rules of interaction among the individuals. However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one.},

Here we show that both speed and accuracy of decision making increase with group size in fish shoals under predation threat. We examined two plausible mechanisms for this improvement: first, that groups are guided by a small proportion of high-quality decision makers and, second, that group members use self-organized division of vigilance. Repeated testing of individuals showed no evidence of different decision-making abilities between individual fish. Instead, we suggest that shoals achieve greater decision-making efficiencies through division of labor combined with social information transfer. Our results should prompt reconsideration of how we view cooperation in animal groups with fluid membership.},

However, there is very little evidence on how rail passengers value different seating experiences. On the back of exploratory research, and including attitudinal evidence, this paper provides significant and original insights into rail passenger{\textquoteright}s preferences in this area. The primary evidence base is a Stated Preference experiment, complemented by a novel Revealed Preference exercise that uses CCTV footage to observe where rail passengers prefer to sit.

The valuations, expressed as travel time multipliers, obtained from the Stated Preference exercise are generally plausible and exhibit a wide range according to the precise seating configuration, the occupancy level and the seating position within a layout. The innovative Revealed Preference analysis provides an encouraging degree of support to the Stated Preference results which, reassuringly, can themselves be reconciled with related valuations widely used in the railway industry in Britain and also the findings of the exploratory and attitudinal research. Whilst we are interested here solely in obtaining valuations, we demonstrate how they can be used in demand forecasting.},

  abstract = {The accuracy and believability of crowd simulations underpins computational studies of human collective behaviour, with implications for urban design, policing, security and many other areas. Accuracy concerns the closeness of the fit between a simulation and observed data, and believability concerns the human perception of plausibility. In this paper, we address both issues via a so-called `Turing test' for crowds, using movies generated from both accurate simulations and observations of real crowds. The fundamental question we ask is `Can human observers distinguish between real and simulated crowds' In two studies with student volunteers (n = 384 and n = 156), we find that non-specialist individuals are able to reliably distinguish between real and simulated crowds when they are presented side-by-side, but they are unable to accurately classify them. Classification performance improves slightly when crowds are presented individually, but not enough to out-perform random guessing. We find that untrained individuals have an idealized view of human crowd behaviour which is inconsistent with observations of real crowds. Our results suggest a possible framework for establishing a minimal set of collective behaviours that should be integrated into the next generation of crowd simulation models.},

Following the Theory of Event Coding (Hommel, M\"usseler, Aschersleben, & Prinz, 2001b), the authors suggest that perceptual dimensions may be intentionally weighted with respect to an intended action. More interesting, the action-related influences were observed only when participants searched for a predefined target.

However, comfortable moving is surely a demand of pedestrian in normal situations. Recently, Voronoi diagram had been successfully adopted to obtain the local density of a pedestrian in empirical studies. In this paper, Voronoi diagram is introduced into the heuristics based pedestrian flow model. It provides not only local density but also other information for determining moving velocity and direction. Those information include personal space, safe distance, neighbors, and three elementary characteristics directions. Several typical scenarios are set up to verify the proposed model. The simulation results show that the velocity-density relations and capacities of bottleneck are consistent with the empirical data, and many self-organization phenomena, i.e., arching phenomenon and lane formation, are also reproduced. The pedestrians are likely to be homogeneously distributed when they are sensitive to local density, otherwise pedestrians are non-uniformly distributed and the stop-and-go waves are likely to be reproduced. Such results indicate that the Voronoi diagram is a promising tool in modeling pedestrian dynamics.},

For the sake of convenience, the three direction choices are respectively called destination direction, following direction, and detour direction in this paper. Here, it is found that the featured direction choices could be inspired by the shape characteristics of the Voronoi diagram. To be specific, in the Voronoi cell of a pedestrian, the direction to a Voronoi node is regarded as a potential "detour" direction and the direction perpendicular to a Voronoi link is regarded as a potential "following" direction. A pedestrian generally owns several alternative Voronoi nodes and Voronoi links in a Voronoi cell, and the optimal detour and following direction are determined by considering related factors such as deviation. Plus the destination direction which is directly pointing to the destination, the three basic direction choices are defined in a Voronoi cell. In order to evaluate the Voronoi diagram based basic directions, the empirical trajectory data in both uni- and bi-directional flow experiments are extracted. A time series method considering the step frequency is used to reduce the original trajectories' swaying phenomena which might disturb the recognition of actual forward direction. The deviations between the empirical velocity direction and the basic directions are investigated, and each velocity direction is classified into a basic direction or regarded as an inexplicable direction according to the deviations. The analysis results show that each basic direction could be a potential direction choice for a pedestrian. The combination of the three basic directions could cover most empirical velocity direction choices in both uni- and bi-directional flow experiments.},

Critical results regarding the evacuees travel time, pre-movement time, movement speed and typical behaviour, such as leadership behaviour and following behaviour, were collected. It was found that evacuation time increased, movement speed decreased and flow at exits became discontinuous when visibility was reduced. Group behaviour had a negative effect on evacuation in normal visibility, but the group effect was basically positive in the reduced visibility scenarios. A number of interesting findings were generated. Larger sized groups tend to move side by side, forming a horizontal structure. Smaller sized groups are more likely to form a vertical structure. Similarly, groups with a leader demonstrated vertical movement, distinct from the horizontal movement of groups without a leader. Following behaviour was more notably observed and is advantageous to overall evacuation when visibility reduced. The results of the pre-experiment questionnaire showed that over 80\% of the participants walk in groups on campus. The daily walking groups tended to maintain their moving forms even in the case of an emergency evacuation. Physical touch was more widely demonstrated in the emergency groups than in the daily groups. This study furthers the understanding of human behaviour in different visibility evacuation conditions and recognition of the impacts of social groups on crowd dynamics.},

 abstract = {20Cellular automaton (CA) approach has been widely used in pedestrian flow studies. However, one problem of CA approach is that gridlock usually occurs in counter flow. One possible reason is that CA models still do not represent correctly cognitive processes of real people. To study whether the gridlock would occur when real people were required to walk in discrete space and time, we performed an experimental study on pedestrian counter flow. Remarkable collaboration behaviours of pedestrians have been observed, which enable the formation of exit rows and prevent the formation of gridlock. Furthermore, we performed a comparative experiment in which pedestrians walked under normal condition. Our studies indicate that to fully describe pedestrian counter flow with CA approach, the remarkable collaboration behaviours of pedestrians need to be considered. Moreover, one might also need to consider other factors such as flexible characteristics of pedestrians, small cell size, and various walk speeds.},

 abstract = {The floor field cellular automaton model (FFCA) has been widely adopted to simulate pedestrian and evacuation dynamics. Many self-organized phenomena could be reproduced with the FFCA model, such as the lane formation in bidirectional pedestrian flow. However, as presented in this study, when we tried to use the FFCA model to simulate an experiment on bidirectional pedestrian flows performed in discrete space and time, we found the model failed to agree with the empirical results. The gridlock formation (not observed in the experiment) was unavoidable in the FFCA model and the clearance time in simulation was much larger than that of the experiment. From the experiments, we observed that people would like to stop if they would foresee a benefit in the near feature and consequently give way to people coming from the opposite direction. This inspired us to incorporate such behavioral rules for modeling pedestrian movements in bidirectional flows. To this end, we introduced a waiting time rule to the original FFCA model. Results showed the performance of the model could be significantly improved. The gridlock probability could be reduced to zero, with clearance time agreeing well with the experimental outcome. Findings from this study can provide meaningful insights for researchers into understanding the pedestrian behavior in bidirectional flow and help develop more reliable simulation software.},

Our strategy including the procedure for updating the position of each pedestrian is explained. It is shown that the movement of pedestrians in an oblique direction to the grid is successfully simulated by RCA, which was not taken into account in the previous CA models.

In such scenarios, body orientation often differs from walking direction, e.g., a pedestrian may step sideways. The deviation between body orientation and walking direction during collision avoidance was studied by quantitatively evaluating the body rotation for counter-flows in narrow corridors. Simple experiments, in which two pedestrians passed each other, were conducted. It was found that pedestrians rotated their bodies when the corridor width was smaller than the sum of the widths of the two pedestrians. This behavior was explained by analyzing the geometry of two ellipses circumscribing each other in a narrow corridor. A preliminary model was developed, and the deviation between the body orientation and walking direction during passing was successfully simulated. Finally, a cross-flow experiment, which is much more complex and realistic than the passing experiments, was performed; it was confirmed that body rotation behavior is also a critical factor in complex and realistic scenarios.},

In our model, there are two kinds of particles, which are right-going particles and left-going particles. They often face opponent particles, so that they swerve to the right or left stochastically in order to avoid conflicts. The particles reinforce their preferences of the swerving direction after their successful avoidance. The preference is also weakened by memory-loss effect. Result of our simulation indicates that cooperative avoiding behavior is achieved, i.e., swerving directions of the particles are unified, when the density of particles is close to 1/2 and the memory-loss rate is small. Furthermore, when the right-going particles occupy the majority of the system, we observe that their flow increases when the number of left-going particles, which prevent the smooth movement of right-going particles, becomes large. It is also investigated that the critical memory-loss rate of the cooperative avoiding behavior strongly depends on the size of the system. Small system can prolong the cooperative avoiding behavior in wider range of memory-loss rate than large system.},

The phenomenon of the kin behavior often occurs during evacuation. In this paper, a two-dimensional Cellular Automata model is applied to simulate the process of evacuation with respect to the kin behavior. Many interesting phenomena during real evacuation, such as incoherence, jamming, gathering, backtracking and waiting, are simulated by the variation of the building structure, the occupants' arrangement, the kin attraction and the route selection. We conclude that the psychology of going with the crowd is not always harmful; the conclusions about the kin behavior in one-exit case are the same as those in two-exits case; the number of the sub-groups and the members in each sub-group influence the evacuation efficiency a lot; the typical phenomena of waiting and backtracking in real evacuation do reduce the evacuation efficiency. We have preliminarily found that the proper kin behavior is beneficial to improve the evacuation efficiency.},

  abstract = {In the subway platform, not all passengers distribute randomly but gather in the waiting areas, especially when a train is coming. During emergency evacuations, passengers' initial distribution may play a significant role in affecting the escape efficiency. In this paper, a passenger distribution modelling method is proposed to predict such waiting area choice processes based on ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, which is really a complicated job due to many influence factors. The model considers the distance to the target waiting area, the length of queues, the physical length of waiting areas and the train schedule as four main influence factors. Specially, a modification of the passenger's impatience factor in the famous social force model (SFM), better reflecting the change of psychological states with an arrival of a train, is presented. The field data collected at the Xuanwumen subway platform is utilized for the model calibration and validation. The ultimate simulation results demonstrate that passenger distributions based on ACO algorithm basically can reflect the field distribution and also the dynamic characteristics of waiting area choice processes. Impacts of passenger distributions on evacuation dynamics under fires are further studied based on the software FDS+Evac. The results indicate that passenger distribution does has little impact on evacuation efficiency when fires are not very large, while the evacuation will be affected significantly by passenger distributions once fires are large enough. This further indicates the necessity of studying the passenger distribution at the subway platform especially under emergencies.},

Traditional models can simulate general crowd dynamics which have the advantages of both microscopic and macroscopic models. The recent studies of crowd simulation from group simulation to social psychology crowds are possible to simulate realistic crowds. The purpose of this review is to introduce commonly used crowd simulation methods for newcomers to this field by making a systematic literature review, discussions and analysis of different models. The results reveal the traditional models can simulate most of the normal crowds, but lack expressiveness for special groups which needs to be solved urgently in the current applications, particularly on visual effects and urban planning. Group simulation and emotion contagion could improve the simulation realism, but it also needs to be improved in computation cost and model optimization. Also, future research directions are suggested aiming to develop new applications focused on more realistic, natural and efficient crowd simulation.},

 abstract = {Computer Vision (CV) based surveillance in crowded scenes is one of the most significant and promising topics due to the increase of people gatherings in public places where the possibilities of disasters and stampedes is also high. Therefore, it is essential to develop a well established Crowd Disaster Avoidance System (CDAS) for the public safety. In general, CV-CDAS focuses on crowd scene analysis, crowd behavior analysis and crowd management. Either, a stampede may occur due to abnormal behavior of individuals in a crowd or a crowd may behave abnormally after the stampede. Even though behavior analysis of a crowd plays an essential role, it is inadequate to decide whether a stampede may occur or not at that instance. Despite significant progress and various surveys on crowd scene, crowd modeling and behavior analysis over the past few decades, the existing surveys still fail to discuss and delineate the crowd disaster analysis based on many key aspects as a whole. However, CV-CDAS needs to be developed based on the necessary factors such as the number of cameras (single/multiple), target of interest (an individual/group or crowd), crowd scene (structured/unstructured), crowd motion (static/dynamic), crowd behavior analysis, people count and crowd density estimation, person re-identification in crowd, crowd evacuation, forensic analysis on crowd disaster and computations on crowd analysis. Consequently, taking all these factors into an account, this survey aims to deliberate a road map to develop a stable CV-CDAS which includes recent trends and approaches in the crowd disaster analysis. In addition, behavior analysis plays a vital role and hence, an extended version of existing survey with the perspective of single and multiple cameras is elaborated. Besides, it summarizes the crowd disaster problem handled by various \{CV\} algorithms in the past and also paves a way to avoid this problem in future. Moreover, this survey presents the existing benchmark datasets with their specifications and performance evaluation metrics with special focus on dataset which will be suitable for specific application and it helps the researchers to select appropriate dataset for evaluation. Finally, this paper concludes with open issues and directions for future research which may further motivate and guide the academic and industrial personnel, involved in developing CV-based crowd disaster management systems.},

The model is conceived in order to perform an evolutionary simulation of some basic parameters that determine the agent's sensorial, cognitive and behavioral system (the perception of the agent's own size, the attraction to the goal, the radius and angle of the field of view and the level of the theory of mind).

In this preliminary work we present our model, show that it reproduces some of the simplest organized behaviors of a system of pedestrians, and focus on some features of the theory of mind, as the difference between odd and even levels.},

 abstract = {Being determined by human social behaviour, pedestrian group dynamics may depend on 'intrinsic properties' such as the purpose of the pedestrians, their personal relation, gender, age, and body size. In this work we investigate the dynamical properties of pedestrian dyads (distance, spatial formation and velocity) by analysing a large data set of automatically tracked pedestrian trajectories in an unconstrained 'ecological' setting (a shopping mall), whose apparent physical and social group properties have been analysed by three different human coders. We observed that females walk slower and closer than males, that workers walk faster, at a larger distance and more abreast than leisure oriented people, and that inter-group relation has a strong effect on group structure, with couples walking very close and abreast, colleagues walking at a larger distance, and friends walking more abreast than family members. Pedestrian height (obtained automatically through our tracking system) influences velocity and abreast distance, both growing functions of the average group height. Results regarding pedestrian age show that elderly people walk slowly, while active age adults walk at the maximum velocity. Groups with children have a strong tendency to walk in a non-abreast formation, with a large distance (despite a low abreast distance). A cross-analysis of the interplay between these intrinsic features, taking in account also the effect of an 'extrinsic property' such as crowd density, confirms these major results but reveals also a richer structure. An interesting and unexpected result, for example, is that the velocity of groups with children increases with density, at least in the low-medium density range found under normal conditions in shopping malls. Children also appear to behave differently according to the gender of the parent.},

A simple but robust and flexible agent-based system is used for modeling of the crowd dynamics. Such simulations can be performed at any stage of design - from rough sketches to the final blueprints. \{CZ\} allows acquiring the layouts for the simulations in a number of ways: freehand sketches, importing already prepared images and appropriating preprocessed images from commercially available Computer Aided Design programs. These three methods are illustrated with practical examples, followed by a number of simulations compared with the literature or other commercially available programs.},

 abstract = {Movements on stairs have attracted a lot of researchers to study in order to help evacuate as
fast as possible. However, there has been much less awareness for this issue on preference
for stairs and human behaviors under different illuminations. Experiments were carried
out to study the human movement characteristics and human behavior performance
when pedestrians walked down stairs alone. By extracting the positions of pedestrians
on cameras, preference and movement characteristics were studied and discussed, and it
is found that pedestrians would like to choose inner side stairs rather than outside stairs
when stairs were divided into 2 parts. Besides, some conclusions can be drawn when stairs
are divided into three components: when entering into sections under conditions of 100%
and 12% illumination, both females and males have a preference for middle areas when
the width of stairs is about 130 cm, but the preference would change with illumination
conditions. Furthermore, when the illumination is 0%, the mean velocity is 0.50 +/- 0.14
m/s. In addition, the usability to handrails helps to reduce time taken on interfaces or midlandings.
The results help to better understand movement during stair evacuations and are
important for constructing or improving evacuation models.},

 abstract = {Macroscopic pedestrian models for bidirectional flow analysis encounter limitations in describing microscopic dynamics at crosswalks. Pedestrian behavior at crosswalks is typically characterized by the evasive effect with conflicting pedestrians and vehicles and the following effect with leading pedestrians. This study proposes a hybrid approach (i.e., route search and social force-based approach) for modeling of pedestrian movement at signalized crosswalks. The key influential factors, i.e., leading pedestrians, conflict with opposite pedestrians, collision avoidance with vehicles, and compromise with traffic lights, are considered. Aerial video data collected at one intersection in Beijing, China were recorded and extracted. A new calibration approach based on a genetic algorithm is proposed that enables optimization of the relative error of pedestrian trajectory in two dimensions, i.e., moving distance and angle. Model validation is conducted by comparison with the observed trajectories in five typical cases of pedestrian crossing with or without conflict between pedestrians and vehicles. The characteristics of pedestrian flow, speed, acceleration, pedestrian-vehicle conflict, and the lane formation phenomenon were compared with those from two competitive models, thus demonstrating the advantage of the proposed model.},

 abstract = {It is important to study pedestrian stepping behavior and characteristics for facility design and pedestrian flow study due to pedestrians' 
bipedal movement. In this paper, data of steps are extracted based on trajectories of pedestrians from a single-file experiment. It is found that step length and step frequency will decrease 75% and 33%, respectively, when global density increases from 0.46 ped/m to 2.28 ped/m. With the increment of headway, they will first increase and then remain constant when the headway is beyond 1.16 m and 0.91 m, respectively. 
Step length and frequency under different headways can be described well by normal distributions. Meanwhile, relationships between step length and frequency under different headways exist. Step frequency decreases with the increment of step length. However, the decrease tendencies depend on headways as a whole. And there are two decrease tendencies: when the headway is between about 0.6 m and 1.0 m, the decrease rate of the step frequency will increase with the increment of step length; while it will decrease when the headway is beyond about 1.0 m and below about 0.6 m. A model is built based on the experiment results. In fundamental diagrams, the results of simulation agree well with those of experiment. The study can be helpful for understanding pedestrian stepping behavior and designing public facilities.},

 abstract = {With more and more high-rise building springing into the cities, the movement of pedestrians on stairs is of great importance for the evacuation of these facilities; the topic of human performance on stairs has attracted a lot of researcher to study. However, there is still a lack of analysis of specific situations, such as mid-landing and merging behaviors. In this paper we employ a modified version of the Optimal Steps Model, modified by taking block-based floor field into consideration under open boundary conditions, to reproduce movement at mid-landing and study performance of occupants in stairwell. Movements on this kind of stairs are simulated and studied with the help of extended model: achieved results are in accord with previous research in respect of specific flow and fundamental diagram. Lane formations on stairs come into being before mid-landing area through simulations. Furthermore most people reach at the mid-landing by the outside stairs at higher density due to more space and less force from other agents, which is induced that outside of the stairs is good for evacuation. At last the model is implemented to study the effect of stairs geometry on merging behaviors, and it is found when corridor is connected to the landing opposite to the incoming stairs, this structure is biased in favor of occupants from stairs. The work in this paper is intended to better understand movement during stair evacuations and develop a technical foundation for codes and standards requirements as well as egress modeling techniques.},

The formulation is based on a reconstruction of the density distribution and the underlying physics, including the rule for resolving conflicts, which is comparable to that in the floor field cellular automaton model. However, we assume that each pedestrian is familiar with the surroundings, thereby minimizing his or her instantaneous cost. This, in turn, helps reduce the randomness in selecting a target cell, which improves the existing cellular automata modelings, together with the computational efficiency. In the presence of two pedestrian groups, which are distinguished by their destinations, the cost distribution for each group is magnified due to the strong interaction between the two groups. As a typical phenomenon, the formation of lanes in the counter flow is reproduced.},

For various forms of ordering in bidirectional streams, no large differences among density-flow relationships are found in the observed density range. The fundamental diagrams of bidirectional streams with different forms of ordering are compared with those of unidirectional streams.

A large number of models have been proposed to simulate the movement characteristics of pedestrians. The collision-free speed model can qualitatively reproduce many self-organized phenomena well when there is no pushing and squeezing in the crowd. In addition, as a first-order model its computational efficiency is relatively high compared to force-based models. In this work, we validate the model quantitatively against empirical data from bottleneck experiments. The parameters controlling the desired speed and pedestrians' initial position distribution are adjusted to reproduce the empirical data. The Voronoi-method is used to calculate the density, speed and flow. It is shown that the model can reproduce the relation between the flow and the density when the initial density is less than 3.33 m-2. However, other characteristics in the simulation such as trajectories in the bottleneck and relation between flow and bottleneck width diverge to some extent from the experimental findings.},

@article{zhao-2020a-cdyn,
 abstract = {The behaviour of building occupants in the rst stage of an evacuation can dramatically
impact the time required to evacuate buildings. This behaviour has been widely investigated
by scholars with a macroscopic approach tting random distributions to represent the
pre-evacuation time, i.e. time from noticing the rst cue until deliberate movement. However,
microscopic investigations on how building occupants respond to several social and
environmental factors are still rare in the literature.
This paper aims to leverage machine learning as a possible solution to investigate factors
aecting building occupants' decision-making during pre-evacuation stage. In particular, we
focus on applying interpretable machine learning to reveal the interactions among the input
variables and to capture nonlinear relationships between the input variables and the outcome.
As such, we use a well-established machine-learning algorithm|random forest|to
model and predict people's emergency behaviour pre-evacuation. We then apply tools to interpret
the black-box random forest model to extract useful knowledge and gain insights for
emergency planning. Specically, this algorithm is applied here to investigate the behaviour
of 569 building occupants split between ve unannounced evacuation drills in a cinema theatre.
The results indicate that both social and environmental factors aect the probability
of responding. Several independent variables, such as the time elapsed after the alarm has
started and the decision-maker's group size, are presenting strong nonlinear relationships
with the probability of switching to the response stage. Furthermore, we nd interactions
exist between the row number where the decision-maker sits and the number of responding
occupants visible to her; the complex relationship between the outcome and these two variables
can be visualized by using a two-dimensional partial dependence plot. An interesting
nding is that a decision-maker is more sensitive to the proportion of responding occupants
than the number of them; hence, the people sitting in the back are often responding more
slowly than the people in the front.},

Second, the Powell's method is performed periodically to fine-tune the important parameters of the best individual in the population. Finally, in each generation, the evolutionary operators are performed on a small number of better individuals in the population. These new search mechanisms are integrated into the differential evolution framework to improve the search efficiency. To validate its effectiveness, the proposed DESAP is applied to two crowd model calibration cases. The results demonstrate that the proposed DESAP outperforms several model calibration methods in terms of solution accuracy and search efficiency.},

Moreover the prognosis of place and time of critical bottlenecks within the building during the evacuation is critical due to complex building structures and the correct pedestrian behavior. Therefore, an extensive validation and calibration of the simulation algorithms is an indispensable requirement for every simulation tool. An automatic test suite for different scenarios will facilitate this task yielding in proven, automated and reproducible results.

The tool can be used to guide the crowd evacuation and prepare respond plans for emergent situations as reference to city council and law enforcement agency. It is important that the simulation results reveal the true behavior of pedestrian; for certain precaution actions can be taken in order to guarantee the safety of the crowd.

In this paper, we documented the performance of our simulator tested with all 14 scenarios proposed by the RiMEA (Richtlinie fur Mikroskopische Entfluchtungs-Analysen) guideline. The test results show that our simulator passes all the tests. Moreover, our pedestrian simulator constantly improves its performance by cooperating with construction companies and government departments running on-site tests with first-hand data.

Inspired by Dirk Hartmann, the Optimal Steps Model, which was developed at the University of Applied Sciences Munich, is extended to navigation around pedestrain groups and queueing. In his contribution, Dirk Hartmann considers a new method for dynamic medium scale navigation in microscopic pedestrian simulation. The central idea is to replace the constant speed function F = 1 in the Eikonal equation by a speed function that depends on the local density. A new contribution is to calculate potential differentials to consider the influence of walking direction and walking speed on navigation behavior. Another important part of this work is a first contribution to forced-based modelling of queueing. The idea is to increase the speed F for areas with a high local pedestrian density. An adequate definition of density is required and has to be discussed. It will be shown that the measurement of the density can be done efficiently using image processing techniques.},

To find the shortest travel time to a target, a common technique is to solve the eikonal equation on a mesh. We propose EikMesh, an extension of the DistMesh algorithm. EikMesh is a fast parallel mesh generator that reduces the number of mesh points, and thus the computation time, while maintaining precision of numerical solvers on the mesh. It automatically refines where desired, in our case, where the eikonal equation undergoes changes, e.g. near obstacles. The first crucial step is the generation of a sophisticated initial mesh which reduces the number of smoothing steps. In addition, EikMesh avoids expensive Delaunay-re-triangulations. Space filling curves manage storage space in a cache-friendly manner. EikMesh scales better than the parallelized traditional DistMesh and significantly outperforms it for a number of test cases.},

  abstract  = {Unlike many dynamical systems in physics, there is no universally accepted locomotion model for crowd dynamics. On the contrary, many different approaches compete, of which some are more suitable for a specific scenario, like evacuations, than others. We showcase how to compare microscopic models based on a real-world experiment using the open-source simulation framework Vadere and two models: the Optimal Steps Model and the Behavioral Heuristics Model. Aside from quantitative aspects, we discuss visual results. Both models are able to reproduce the density-speed relation to a reasonable degree. We also identify model characteristics that led to deviations, thus enhancing our understanding of both models and facilitating the decision which model to choose to investigate a particular real-world situation.},

[17]), consisting of a nonlinear conservation law for the density of pedestrians coupled with an eikonal equation for a potential modelling the common sense of the task. For such an approximated system we prove existence and uniqueness of entropy solutions (in one space dimension) in the sense of Kruzkov [22], in which the boundary conditions are posed following the approach of Bardos et al. [7]. We use BV estimates on the density and stability estimates on the potential in order to prove uniqueness. Furthermore, we analyse the evolution of characteristics for the original Hughes' model in one space dimension and study the behaviour of simple solutions, in order to reproduce interesting phenomena related to the formation of shocks and rarefaction waves. The characteristic calculus is supported by numerical simulations.},

 abstract = {Stair ascending performance is critical during evacuation from buildings and underground infrastructures. Healthy subjects performed self-paced ascent in three settings: 13 floor building, 31 floor building, 33 m stationary subway escalator. 
To investigate leg muscle and cardiorespiratory capacities and how they constrain performance, oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate (HR) and ascending speed were measured in all three; electromyography (EMG) in the first two. The \{VO2\} and \{HR\} ranged from 89 to 96% of 
the maximum capacity reported in the literature. The average highest \{VO2\} and \{HR\} ranged from 39 to 41 mL kg -1 min -1 and 162 to 174
b min -1, respectively. The subjects were able to sustain their initial preferred maximum pace for a short duration, while the average step rate was 92 95 steps per min. In average, \{VO2\} reached relatively stable values at bout 37 mL kg -1 min -1 . \{EMG\} amplitudes decreased significantly and frequencies were unchanged. Speed reductions indicate that climbing capacity declined in the process of 
fatigue development. In the two buildings, the reduction of muscle power allowed the subjects to extend their tolerance and complete ascents in the 48 m and 109 m high stairways in 2.9 and 7.8 min, respectively. Muscle activity interpretation squares were developed and 
proved advantageous to observe fatigue and recovery over time.},

@article{helbing-2012-cdyn,
 abstract = {Each year, crowd disasters happen in different areas of the world. How and why do
such disasters happen? Are the fatalities caused by relentless behavior of people or a
psychological state of panic that makes the crowd go mad? Or are they a tragic
consequence of a breakdown of coordination? These and other questions are
addressed, based on a qualitative analysis of publicly available videos and materials,
which document the planning and organization of the Love Parade in Duisburg,
Germany, and the crowd disaster on July 24, 2010. Our analysis reveals a number of
misunderstandings that have widely spread. We also provide a new perspective on
concepts such as intentional pushing, mass panic, stampede, and crowd crushes.
The focus of our analysis is on the contributing causal factors and their mutual
interdependencies, not on legal issues or the judgment of personal or institutional
responsibilities. Video recordings show that people stumbled and piled up due to a
domino effect, resulting from a phenomenon called crowd turbulence or crowd
quake. Crowd quakes are a typical reason for crowd disasters, to be distinguished
from crowd disasters resulting from mass panic or crowd crushes. In Duisburg,
crowd turbulence was the consequence of amplifying feedback and cascading
effects, which are typical for systemic instabilities. Accordingly, things can go terribly
wrong in spite of no bad intentions from anyone. Comparing the incident in Duisburg
with others, we give recommendations to help prevent future crowd disasters. In
particular, we introduce a new scale to assess the criticality of conditions in the crowd.
This may allow preventative measures to be taken earlier on. Furthermore, we discuss
the merits and limitations of citizen science for public investigation, considering that
today, almost every event is recorded and reflected in the World Wide Web.},

In the model, at first, the calculation formula of target position in the next time step is given according to direction gain and collision gain, and the system evolution rules are defined. Second, the experiment is conducted with the simulation platform to study the relationships of average system velocity, flow, system scale, pedestrian density and stair series for obtaining the bi-directional pedestrian flow characteristic. The results of numerical analysis had shown that when the pedestrian density reached the critical value, the pedestrian flow was changed from free flow status to blocking flow status, and the distribution ratio of bi-directional pedestrians and channel width had great effect on the average system velocity and the flow. Moreover, the more the stair series was, the more obvious the faster-is-slower effect was.},

 abstract = {Planning pedestrian environments requires assumptions about how pedestrians will respond to characteristics of the environment as they formulate and enact their walking itineraries. As a consequence, most research interest in public environments focuses on behavior in relation to those characteristics. For example, there is a substantial body of descriptive and typological studies of pedestrian environments. Metric, geometric, and topological models have proved useful in characterizing density and direction of movement. The need to understand the mechanism of choice has prompted microscale and laboratory-based research on exploratory spatial behavior within walking districts. Studies of behavior in relation to comfort, the way in which images of places impinge on choices, and how dynamic and serial experience of the city affects individual itineraries have all developed as specialized fields of understanding. In general, studies of pedestrian environment dynamics have both diversified and multiplied as its systems and methodologies are adapted for planning other environments.},

In many situations a mesoscopic representation is to favor over a microscopic one.

Nevertheless, there are still situations where a microscopic simulation is needed and wanted. Examples are crossing pedestrian streams, bidirectional flows at high densities, and the simulation of pedestrians with multiple destinations (e.g. pedestrian movement in shopping malls). One approach that takes advantage of both kinds of models is a hybrid combination in which the microscopic model is applied where needed and the mesoscopic model where plausible. This work focuses on the hybrid combination of a mesoscopic queuing model and a microscopic model that is based on considering obstacles in velocity space.

As the human driver recognises travel-times rather than distances, faster roads appear to be 'shorter' than slower ones. The resulting metric space has an effective dimension $$ , which is a significant measure of the heterogeneity of road speeds. We found that traffic strongly concentrates on only a small fraction of the roads. The distribution of vehicular flows over the roads obeys a power law, indicating a clear hierarchical order of the roads.

The model uses simplified retinal processes to translate neighbor movement patterns into information through spatial signal integration and threshold responses. The structure provides a mechanism by which individuals can vary their sets of influential neighbors, a measure of an individual's sensory load. Sensory loads are correlated with group order and density, and we discuss their adaptive values in an ecological context. The model also provides a mechanism by which group members can identify, and rapidly respond to, novel visual stimuli.},

 abstract = {Animals are capable of enhanced decision making through cooperation, whereby accurate decisions can occur quickly through decentralized consensus. These interactions often depend upon reliable social cues, which can result in highly coordinated activities in uncertain environments. Yet information within a crowd may be lost in translation, generating confusion and enhancing individual risk. As quantitative data detailing animal social interactions accumulate, the mechanisms enabling individuals to rapidly and accurately process competing social cues remain unresolved. Here, we model how motion-guided attention influences the exchange of visual information during social navigation. We also compare the performance of this mechanism to the hypothesis that robust social coordination requires individuals to numerically limit their attention to a set of n-nearest neighbours. While we find that such numerically limited attention does not generate robust social navigation across ecological contexts, several notable qualities arise from selective attention to motion cues. First, individuals can instantly become a local information hub when startled into action, without requiring changes in neighbour attention level. Second, individuals can circumvent speed{\textendash}accuracy trade-offs by tuning their motion thresholds. In turn, these properties enable groups to collectively dampen or amplify social information. Lastly, the minority required to sway a group{\textquoteright}s short-term directional decisions can change substantially with social context. Our findings suggest that motion-guided attention is a fundamental and efficient mechanism underlying collaborative decision making during social navigation.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a video data-driven social force model for simulating crowd evacuation. The initialization of pedestrian position, path navigation, and goal selection in the improved social force model was guided by real video data. To initialize pedestrian position and determine path navigation, the distribution of the pedestrians is set according to the real video. We also extracted the trajectories of pedestrian movement from the videos, and these trajectories were stored into a path set to guide the evacuation of pedestrians. Moreover, a fitness function was defined to model the behavior of a pedestrian goal selection. The fitness function could process the evacuation parameters, which were extracted from the video, and consider the degree and distance of exit congestion. Furthermore, we quantified the relationship values among pedestrians, and a new force called group force was added to the primary social force model. Pedestrians with close relationship gathered into one group and walked together. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the video data-driven model was applied to simulate campus halls and roads. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is consistent with real-world situations and can assist in analyzing evacuation scenarios.},

 abstract = {Verification and validation (V&V) of pedestrian dynamics models have
become a subject of extensive discussions over the last few years. While
some requirements and tests are proper for all models, simultaneously
each type of model requires also its own set of specific tests. In models
based on Cellular Automata (CA) discretization of space and time is
the main source of possible errors. This paper addresses some issues,
that should be carefully investigated in order to obtain a final, reliable
model.
The negative effects of discretization are discussed, as well as, the
problem of maintaining pedestrian speed in different grid configurations
i.e. movement isotropy. In parallel we show that wall penetration can
occur in CA models and that input geometry has to be validated. The
issue of automatic detection of collective effects in CA-based models is
mentioned. Finally, the necessity of fundamental diagram application in
validation is broadly discussed.
The aim of this paper is to bring the CA-based pedestrian dynamics
models into current general discussion about V&V and to indicate
specific issues of CA-based models.},

 abstract = {How to model pedestrian movement is an intriguing problem in the area of statistical physics. As a common phenomenon of pedestrian movement, fatigue has a significant negative effect on pedestrian movement, especially when pedestrians move or run with heavy luggage, rescue the wounded in disaster, climb stairs and etc. According to the field observations and previous researches, fatigue coefficient is defined as the decrease of desired velocity in this study. However, previous researches lacked quantitative analysis of the effect of fatigue on pedestrian speed. It has been a great challenge to study the effect of fatigue on pedestrian flow, since pedestrians of heterogeneous walking abilities and the change of pedestrians moving properties need to be taken into consideration. Thus, at first, a series of pedestrian experiments, under three different conditions, were conducted to formulate the empirical relationship among fatigue, average free velocity, and walking distance. Then the empirical formulation of pedestrian fatigue was imported into the multi-velocity field floor cellular automata (FFCA) model for following pedestrian dynamics analysis. The velocity ratio was adjusted dynamically to adapt the change of pedestrians velocity due to fatigue. The fatigue, entrance flow rate and pedestrian's initial desired velocity are found to have significant effects on the pedestrian flow. The space-time distributions of pedestrian density and velocity were explored in detail, with phase transition analyses from a free flow phase to a congestion phase. Additionally, the  density wave  in the system can be observed if a certain ratio of burdened pedestrians lay in the high density region. The envelope of the  density wave reaches its maximum amplitude around the entrance position, and gradually diminishes away from the entrance.},

 abstract = {This paper analyzes the emergent behaviors of pedestrian groups that learn through the multiagent reinforcement learning model developed in our group. Five scenarios studied in the pedestrian model literature, and with different levels of complexity, were simulated in order to analyze the robustness and the scalability of the model. Firstly, a reduced group of agents must learn by interaction with the environment in each scenario. In this phase, each agent learns its own kinematic controller, that will drive it at a simulation time. Secondly, the number of simulated agents is increased, in each scenario where agents have previously learnt, to test the appearance of emergent macroscopic behaviors without additional learning. This strategy allows us to evaluate the robustness and the consistency and quality of the learned behaviors. For this purpose several tools from pedestrian dynamics, such as fundamental diagrams and density maps, are used. The results reveal that the developed model is capable of simulating human-like micro and macro pedestrian behaviors for the simulation scenarios studied, including those where the number of pedestrians has been scaled by one order of magnitude with respect to the situation learned.},

 abstract = {We address here the issue of congestion in the modeling of crowd motion, in the non-smooth framework: contacts between people are not anticipated and avoided, they actually occur, and they are explicitly taken into account in the model. We limit our approach to very basic principles in terms of behavior, to focus on the particular problems raised by the non-smooth character of the models. We consider that individuals tend to move according to a desired, or spontanous, velocity. We account for congestion by assuming that the evolution realizes at each time an instantaneous balance between individual tendencies and global constraints (overlapping is forbidden): the actual velocity is defined as the closest to the desired velocity among all admissible ones, in a least square sense. We develop those principles in the microscopic and macroscopic settings, and we present how the framework of Wasserstein distance between measures allows to recover the sweeping process nature of the problem on the macroscopic level, which makes it possible to obtain existence results in spite of the non-smooth character of the evolution process. Micro and macro approaches are compared, and we investigate the similarities together with deep differences of those two levels of description.},

 abstract = {In 2013 the Heat Method was presented as an alternative to the Fast Marching Method to compute geodesic distances in 2D and 3D. The Heat Method has a potential to be very fast, because its numerical solution cuts down to solving linear systems of equations, which can be parallelized. This work analyzes the suitability of the Heat Method for geodesic distance computation in pedestrian dynamics simulation. The thesis reveals several limitations of the Heat Method on 2D domains, which are of general interest. This is done by presenting numerical experiments using unstructured triangle meshes as spatial discretization. In the experiments linear numerical convergence is lost in the L2-Norm when the boundary is not smooth. It is also demonstrated that the method is sensitive to round-off errors. The latter finding is also true for closed 3D surfaces. The limitations of the Heat Method found in this study are not discussed in the original publication paper (2013). The findings of this work serve as additional information for users who consider using the Heat Method for geodesic distance computation instead of the Fast Marching Method.},

 abstract = {Self-organized and error-resistant control of distributed autonomous robotic units in a manufacturing environment with obstacles where the robotic units have to be assigned to manufacturing targets in a cost effective way, is achieved by using two fundamental principles of nature. First, the selection behavior of modes is used which appears in pattern formation of physical, chemical and biological systems. Coupled selection equations based on these pattern formation principles can be used as dynamical system approach to assignment problems. These differential equations guarantee feasibility of the obtained solutions which is of great importance in industrial applications. Second, a model of behavioral forces is used, which has been successfully applied to describe self-organized crowd behavior of pedestrians. This novel approach includes collision avoidance as well as error resistivity. In particular, in systems where failures are of concern, the suggested approach outperforms conventional methods in covering up for sudden external changes like breakdowns of some robotic units. The capability of this system is demonstrated in computer simulations.},

 abstract = {Understanding the collective dynamics of crowd movements during stressful emergency situations is central to reducing the risk of deadly crowd disasters. Yet, their systematic experimental study remains a challenging open problem due to ethical and methodological constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate the viability of shared three-dimensional virtual environments as an experimental platform for conducting crowd experiments with real people. In particular, we show that crowds of real human subjects moving and interacting in an immersive three-dimensional virtual environment exhibit typical patterns of real crowds as observed in real-life crowded situations. These include the manifestation of social conventions and the emergence of self-organized patterns during egress scenarios. High-stress evacuation experiments conducted in this virtual environment reveal movements characterized by mass herding and dangerous overcrowding as they occur in crowd disasters. We describe the behavioural mechanisms at play under such extreme conditions and identify critical zones where overcrowding may occur. Furthermore, we show that herding spontaneously emerges from a density effect without the need to assume an increase of the individual tendency to imitate peers. Our experiments reveal the promise of immersive virtual environments as an ethical, cost-efficient, yet accurate platform for exploring crowd behaviour in high-risk situations with real human subjects.},

The two cases are presented: the one with two types of walkers and the other with four types of walkers. In the two types of walkers, the first is the random walker going to the right and the second is the random walker going up. In the four types of walkers, the first, second, third, and fourth are, respectively, the random walkers going to the right, left, up, and down. It is found that the dynamical jamming transitions occur at the critical densities. The transition points do not depend on the system size for large system but depend strongly on the strength of drift. The jamming transitions are compared with that obtained by the cellular automaton model of car traffic.},

 abstract = {This dissertation addresses the problem of bringing the perspectives of psychology and sociology about human behavior in emergencies into computational models for egress analysis. Efficacious analysis of emergency egress is facilitated by incorporation of diverse human behavior into a Multi-Agent Simulation System for Egress analysis (MASSEgress). MASSEgress adopts a multi-agent based simulation paradigm to model evacuees as individual agents equipped with sensors, brains and actuators. Individual behavior is simulated through modeling of sensing, decision-making, behavior selection and motor control. Social behavior is simulated through modeling of individual behavior and interactions among individuals. Competitive, queuing, herding, and leader-following behaviors are modeled. MASSEgress is a computational framework; its modular design allows easy extensions to include additional behavior types. A set of computational methods including point-test and ray-tracing algorithms, and decision-trees are incorporated into MASSEgress to simulate the sensing, decision-making, behavior selection, and motor control of evacuees. A grid method is utilized to perform collision detection among large number of agents with an O(N) time complexity, and K-Means clustering algorithm is utilized to develop statistical procedures for drawing evacuation patterns from multiple simulations. Comparisons of MASSEgress with other evacuation models have been performed to demonstrate its capabilities as well as to validate the computational framework with prior results. Simulation to replicate a historical event - evacuation at a Rhode Island nightclub has also been carried out. Finally, an application of MASSEgress to simulate emergency evacuation of a multi-story university building is performed to illustrate the potential utilization of the simulation system for egress design analysis.},

However, due to the scarcity of human and social behavioral data, these computational tools rely on assumptions that have been found inconsistent or unrealistic. This paper presents a multi-agent based framework for simulating human and social behavior during emergency evacuation. A prototype system has been developed, which is able to demonstrate some emergent behaviors, such as competitive, queuing, and herding behaviors. For illustration, an example application of the system for safe egress design is provided.},

 comment = {Unfortunately the authors fail to mention why their approach should be more consistent or more realisitic then the former approaches whose lack of realism the authors deplore. The agent based model framework does not use observations to validate. Input from the social sciences and psychology is considered in an abstract fashion only - through literature citations. There is no investigation of stability and robustness, a typical weekness, when different behaviours have to be balanced in a Reynold's style model such as this. In short, the model lacks validation. It's worth may lie in a solid SW structure - which I cannot judge.},

 abstract = {Diese Arbeit untersucht den Stationshalt von hochrangigen, innerst{\"a}dtischen Verkehren. Unter
diesem Sammelbegriff lassen sich leistungsf{\"a}hige S-Bahn- und U-Bahnsysteme zusammenfassen,
welche den urbanen Ballungsraum in dichtem Takt erschlie{\ss}en. Beim Stationshalt bzw. der
Stationshaltezeit handelt es sich um die Zeitspanne zwischen dem Halteruck eines Zuges in einer
Station und dem darauffolgenden Anfahrruck bei der Abfahrt des Zuges. Jeder Stationshalt dient
einzig und allein dem Fahrgastwechsel.
Jeder Stationshalt l{\"a}sst sich in einzelne Vorg{\"a}nge unterteilen, die allesamt Einfluss auf die
Stationshaltezeit haben. Darunter fallen technische Vorg{\"a}nge, wie etwa das {\"O}ffnen und Schlie{\ss}en der T{\"u}ren, der Fahrgastwechsel und auch betrieblich normative Vorg{\"a}nge (das Abfertigen und Ingangsetzen des Zuges). Jeder dieser Vorg{\"a}nge ist ein Einflussfaktor, dem ein bestimmter Zeitanteil am Stationsaufenthalt zugewiesen werden kann. Letztendlich bestimmt die Summe aller Einzelvorg{\"a}nge die Stationshaltezeit bzw. definiert die Summe aller Einflussfaktoren bei gegebener
Stationshaltezeit jene Zeitspanne, die f{\"u}r den Fahrgastwechsel zur Verf{\"u}gung steht.

 abstract = {We study the evacuation of a set of 200 pedestrians from a room under a state of panic. The dynamics of the pedestrians is given by the Social Force Model. The degree of panic is controlled by a parameter v d which represents the velocity at which pedestrians wish to move. We show that the "faster is slower effect" can be understood in terms of the works performed by the different forces present in the system and the role played by dissipative terms in the model. Beyond the maximum flow rate the "granular cluster" mass distribution displays a transition from exponentially decaying to "U-shaped" as this value of v d evacuation efficiency begins to decrease rapidly.},

Vicsek, Nature (London) 407, 487 (2000)]. FIS refers to the finding that, under certain conditions, an excess of the individuals' vigor in the attempt to exit causes a decrease in the flow rate. In general, this effect is identified by the appearance of a minimum when plotting the total evacuation time of a crowd as a function of the pedestrian desired velocity. Here, we experimentally show that the FIS effect indeed occurs in three different systems of discrete particles flowing through a constriction: (a) humans evacuating a room, (b) a herd of sheep entering a barn, and (c) grains flowing out a 2D hopper over a vibrated incline. This finding suggests that FIS is a universal phenomenon for active matter passing through a narrowing.},

Typical approaches either resemble particle simulations (where agents lack orientation controls) or are conservative in the range of human motion possible (agents lack psychological state and aren't allowed to 'push' each other). Our HiDAC system (for High-Density Autonomous Crowds) focuses on the problem of simulating the local motion and global wayfinding behaviors of crowds moving in a natural manner within dynamically changing virtual environments. By applying a combination of psychological and geometrical rules with a social and physical forces model, HiDAC exhibits a wide variety of emergent behaviors from agent line formation to pushing behavior and its consequences; relative to the current situation, personalities of the individuals and perceived social density.},

 abstract = {There are many applications of computer animation and simulation where it is necessary to model virtual crowds of autonomous agents. Some of these applications include site planning, education, entertainment, training, and human factors analysis for building evacuation. Other applications include simulations of scenarios where masses of people gather, flow, and disperse, such as transportation centers, sporting events, and concerts. Most crowd simulations include only basic locomotive behaviors possibly coupled with a few stochastic actions. Our goal in this survey is to establish a baseline of techniques and requirements for simulating large-scale virtual human populations. Sometimes, these populations might be mutually engaged in a common activity such as evacuation from a building or area; other times they may be going about their individual and personal agenda of work, play, leisure, travel, or spectator. Computational methods to model one set of requirements may not mesh well with good approaches to another. By including both crowd and individual goals and constraints into a comprehensive computational model, we expect to simulate the visual texture and contextual behaviors of groups of seemingly sentient beings.},

 abstract = {The increasing desire for mobility, rising prices of gasoline and steadily growing awareness for environmental issues create a wide range of opportunities for public transport, especially the public railway services. Customization of railway services is a key issue to win over passengers. Handling luggage on the train often constitutes a major obstacle to using trains as a means of transportation. Therefore an improvement in the area of luggage accommodation on trains would result in an increase of comfort for travelers.
The aim of this theses is to determine the amount of luggage carried on passenger trains as well as an analysis of the desires and behavior of passengers. Further a standardization of luggage is conducted. Based on this standardization the appropriate size, allocation and arrangement of areas for luggage accommodation are identified. For this purpose luggage was measured and counted on platforms in Germany and Austria on multiple occasions throughout the year 2007. In addition about 1000 pieces of luggage were measured and weighed at the airports of Vienna and Salzburg. To obtain additional data, surveys among 6500 travelers were conducted on about 160 trains in Germany in summer 2007 and in Switzerland in January 2008. In the course of surveys, videos have been taken to analyze 1500 railway cars.
At the beginning of the thesis passenger structures with consideration of group sizes and travel purposes are examined. The analysis of the behavior of travelers shows that the readiness to lift luggage for storage decreases with the vertical lift, the weight of the object and the age of the travelers. Female travelers are generally less willing to lift luggage, while permanent visual contact is most important for all passengers. According to the conducted survey, passengers want luggage racks close to their seats as well as storage opportunities between the seats. Overhead storage and luggage racks within the entrance area are rejected. Further the luggage arising for different traveler groups and its purpose are determined. Travelers on average carry one piece of luggage and half a piece of hand luggage with them.
In a separate chapter the data from luggage countings and measurements is accurately standardized into categories of trolley / suitcase, bag, backpack and hand luggage as well as into the size categories small, medium, large and weight categories light, medium, heavy. This standardization allows to draw conclusions from the specifications travelers made in the questionnaires on their luggage.
Based on the evaluation of the video recordings, the actual accommodation of luggage and passenger capacity utilization in trains are examined. It is shown that even during high extent of utilization the existing accommodation possibilities (80% in form of overhead storage) are not fully used and luggage items are placed on seats and in the aisle. An increase of difficulties in luggage storing becomes evident when the number of passengers grows to full capacity of the train and therefore leads to an increase of unsatisfied customers.
In the final part of the thesis a computing method is presented which allows to determine the necessary storage capacity according to existing traveling purposes togehter with seating requirements for a railroad car. In addition, measurements are defined to guarantee the maximum amount of storage possibilities. A setting of the luggage racks on the quarter points of the car in addition with evenly distributed storage places between the seats guarantee an arrangement appropriate to the passenger behavior and the costumer requests. By optimizing luggage storage areas according to customer needs, higher customer satisfaction and increased operating efficiency (e.g. shorter passenger change times) can be achieved. This could result in an increase of total number of passengers by 20%.

 abstract = {The aim of the paper is an analysis of self-organization patterns observed in the unidirectional flow of pedestrians. On the basis of experimental data from Zhang et al. [J. Zhang et al., J. Stat. Mech. (2011) P06004], we analyze the mutual positions and velocity correlations between pedestrians when walking along a corridor. The angular and spatial dependencies of the mutual positions reveal a spatial structure that remains stable during the crowd motion. This structure differs depending on the value of n, for the consecutive nth-nearest-neighbor position set. The preferred position for the first-nearest neighbor is on the side of the pedestrian, while for further neighbors, this preference shifts to the axis of movement. The velocity correlations vary with the angle formed by the pair of neighboring pedestrians and the direction of motion and with the time delay between pedestrians' movements. The delay dependence of the correlations shows characteristic oscillations, produced by the velocity oscillations when striding; however, a filtering of the main frequency of individual striding out reduces the oscillations only partially. We conclude that pedestrians select their path directions so as to evade the necessity of continuously adjusting their speed to their neighbors'. They try to keep a given distance, but follow the person in front of them, as well as accepting and observing pedestrians on their sides. Additionally, we show an empirical example that illustrates the shape of a pedestrian's personal space during movement.},

The key question is whether we can specify the psychological processes with sufficient clarity and to precision as to inform these other analysts of crowd dynamics. I will start, then, by outlining four key transformations that occur when people form a psychological crowd. I will then look at three key areas in which this has relevance for the analysis of crowd dynamics and crowd movement. I shall conclude by setting out some priorities for future research.

 abstract = {We describe simple heuristics, based on perceptual variables, that produce human-like trajectories towards moving and stationary targets, and around moving and stationary obstacles. Interception of moving and stationary objects can be achieved through regulation of self-movement to maintain a target at a constant eccentricity, or by cancelling the change (drift) in the eccentricity of the target. We first show how a constant eccentricity strategy can be extended to home in on optimal paths and avoid obstacles. We then identify a simple visual speed ratio that signals a future collision, and the change in path needed for avoidance. The combination of heuristics based on eccentricity and the speed-ratio produces human-like behaviour. The heuristics can be used to animate avatars in virtual environments or to guide mobile robots. Combined with higher-level goal setting and way-finding behaviours, such navigation heuristics could provide the foundation for generative models of natural human locomotion.},

 abstract = {This paper aims to develop a model representing cluster perception in the distribution of point objects. Three spatial factors---that is, proximity, concentration, and density change---are considered to cause cluster perception. To measure these factors, two spatial notions based on the density of point objects are proposed: local density and relative local density. These densities are defined as the functions of a location in a map, and indicate how points are distributed around the location. Cluster perception is represented as a probabilistic function of the measures derived from the relative local density, and its likelihood is shown for model estimation. An experiment in cluster perception indicates that the model is significantly valid, and some empirical findings related to the heterogeneity of map readers in cluster perception are shown.},

 abstract = {Many models from foraging theory and movement ecology assume that resources are encountered randomly. If food locations, types and values are retained in memory, however, search time could be significantly reduced, with concurrent effects on biological fitness. Despite this, little is known about what specific characteristics of foods, particularly those relevant to profitability, nonhuman animals can remember. Building upon previous observations, we hypothesized that chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, after observing foods being hidden in a large wooded test area they could not enter, and after long delays, would direct (through gesture and vocalization) experimentally na\"{i}ve humans to the reward locations in an order that could be predicted beforehand by the spatial and physical characteristics of those items. In the main experiment, various quantities of almonds, both in and out of shells and sealed in transparent bags, were hidden in the test area. The chimpanzees later directed searchers to those items in a nonrandom order related to quantity, shell presence/absence, and the distance they were hidden from the subject. The recovery sequences were closely related to the actual e/h (energy/handling time) profitability of the foods. Predicted recovery orders, based on the energetic value of almonds and independently measured, individual-specific expected pursuit and processing times, were closely related to observed recovery orders. We argue that the information nonhuman animals possess regarding their environment can be extensive, and that further comparative study is vital for incorporating realistic cognitive variables into models of foraging and movement.},

  abstract  = {In pedestrian dynamics, individual-based models serve to simulate the behavior of crowds so that evacuation times and crowd densities can be estimated or the efficiency of public transportation optimized. Often train systems are investigated where seat choice may have a great impact on capacity utilization. Thus it is necessary to reproduce passengers' behavior inside trains. Yet there is surprisingly little research on the subject. In this contribution, we collect data on seating behavior in Munich's suburban trains, analyze it, and subsequently introduce a model that matches what we observe. For example, within a compartment, passengers tend to choose the seat group with the smallest number of other passengers. Within a seat group, passengers prefer window seats and forward-facing seats. When there is already another person, passengers tend to choose the seat diagonally across from that person. These and other aspects are incorporated in our model. We demonstrate the applicability of our model and present a qualitative validation with a simulation example. The model's implementation is part of the free and open-source VADERE simulation framework for pedestrian dynamics and thus available for cross-validation. The model can be used as one component in larger systems for the simulation of public transport.},

Natural discretization of pedestrian movement in continuous space - Notes
Idea: movement is modelled as circle around the person.
Validation: compare to known density vs. velocity diagrams and compare with evacuation experiment.
I. INTRODUCTION
- So far: pedestrian movement is modelled by cellular automata.
+---+---+
| | |
+---+---+
| | |
+---+---+
Drawbacks (differs from real life):
* Each pedestrian has equal size, i.e. the size of one cell.
* No arbitrary direction possible, i.e. only horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
- Better approach: social force models in continuous space and time.
-> Inspired by Newtonian mechanics.
-> High densities => dynamics is dominated by physical mechanisms, e.g. narrowed streets.
-> Low densities => dynamics is dominated by cognitive heuristics.
- Goals:
* Combine both aspects.
* Maintain stepwise movement of cellular automata
* Do not use a spatial grid.
II. MODEL
- Circle around each pedestrian.
- Each pedestrian is driven by desired speed and direction.
-> Speed is fixed attribute of pedestrian but can be increased/decreased.
- After each time step, pedestrians are informed how much time has elapsed.
- Two potentials:
1. Attractive: pedestrian's target has an attractive potential.
2. Repulsive:
* Other pedestrians have a weighted repulsive potential which depends on the Euclidean distance.
-> For simplicity, use same weight for each pedestrian. * Obstacles have a repulsive potential.
-> Use higher weight than for pedestrians (10,000 vs. 1,000).
- At each time, potential for every point in plane can be calculated.
-> A function P(x) which sums up pedestrian's and obstacle's repulsive potentials.
- Idea: this function defines the next step of a pedestrian on "his" circle.
* Use P (paper states -P because it is interpreted as utility function and we want to maximize utility).
* Use gradient descent methods to calculate next step, i.e. the minimum.
* Optimize locally by using a greedy algorithm w/o planning further steps.
* The floor field carries global information to avoid traps.
- Pedestrian's circle is discretized.
-> Noise positions in each step to avoid artefacts.
- Positions are updated sequentially.
-> Effect of sequential updates disappear if simulation time step goes to zero.
III. EMPIRICAL MEASUREMENT OF STEP LENGTHS
- Setup:
* Distance of 12 m.
* Three regimes: walk, jog and run.
- Results:
* At first, step length increases linearly with speed until 4 m/s.
* Then, step length slows down.
IV. DENSITY-SPEED RELATION
- Validate model against known density-speed relations.
- First, velocity of each pedestrian is measured and then the density is calculated (= average )
-> Density is calculated by using Voronoi diagrams.
- Simulation shows identical density vs. speed diagrams compared to Weidmann's diagrams => model is valid.
-> But, simulation shows a systematically faster approach to slower velocity than Weidmann.
=> Therefore, to better fit real life, introduce local density.
V. SIMULATION STUDY AT A BOTTLENECK
Skip this section because it is not so relevant according to Micheal Seitz.
VI. CONCLUSION
- Introduced grid-free trajectories which is a better approach for real-life situations.

 abstract = {Die Simulation von Personenstr\"omen hat sich mittlerweile zu einer anerkannten Methode entwickelt, um Geb\"audepl\"ane zu verbessern und Sicherheit bei Veranstaltungen zu gew\"ahrleisten. In den letzten Jahrzehnten wurden daher viele neue Modelle f\"ur die Bewegung von Personen und Menschenmengen entwickelt. Die meisten dieser Modelle liefern gute Ergebnisse, solange der Fokus der Betrachtung auf der physikalischen Bewegung liegt.  Andererseits wurden jedoch soziale Verhaltensweisen bislang weitgehend ignoriert, obwohl diese das Gesamtverhalten in einer Evakuierung beeinflussen. Die Entwicklung und Auspr\"agungen solcher sozialer Verhaltensweisen wurden von Sozialpsychologen intensiv durch empirische Studien untersucht und in Theorien zusammengefasst.  Allerdings ist ein Gro{\ss}teil dieser psychologischen Modelle nur verbal beschrieben und besitzt eine sehr komplexe Struktur mit vielen Eingangsparametern.  Deshalb fehlen soziale Verhaltensweisen meist in Evakuierungsmodellen, womit entsprechenden Simulationen ein wesentlicher Bestandteil zur tats\"achlichen Abbildung der Realit\"at fehlt.  In dieser interdisziplin\"aren Arbeit werden gut erforschte sozialpsychologische Theorien in mathematische und algorithmische Verhaltensmodelle \"uberf\"uhrt.  Diese neuen Modelle werden mit einem ausf\"uhrlich validierten Fortbewegungsmodell f\"ur Fu{\ss}g\"anger kombiniert und im Forschungssimulator VADERE der Hochschule M\"unchen implementiert. Sie bleiben nahe an den sozialpsychologischen Theorien, behalten dabei jedoch einen \"uberschaubaren Parameterraum.  Die virtuellen Fu{\ss}g\"anger zeigen in den durchgef\"uhrten Simulationen das erwartete, in der Realit\"at beobachtete Verhalten. 
So gelingt durch diese neuen Modelle ein entscheidender Schritt in Richtung realistischere und vertrauensw\"urdigere Simulationen von Personenstr\"omen.},

@article{smaldino-2012-cdyn,
 abstract = {According to optimal distinctiveness theory (ODT; Brewer 1991), individuals prefer social groups that are relatively distinct compared to other groups in the individuals' social environment. Distinctive groups (i.e., groups of moderate relative size) are deemed "optimal" because they allow for feelings of inclusion and social connection while simultaneously providing a basis for differentiating the self from others. However, ODT is a theory about individual preferences and, as such, does not address the important question of what types of groups are actually formed as a function of these individual-level preferences for groups of a certain size. The goal of the current project was to address this gap and provide insight into how the nature of the social environment (e.g., the size of the social neighborhood) interacts with individual-level group size preferences to shape group formation. To do so, we developed an agent-based model in which agents adopted a social group based on an optimal group size preference (e.g., a group whose size represented 20\% of the social neighborhood). We show that the assumptions of optimal distinctiveness theory do not lead to individually satisfactory outcomes when all individuals share the same social environment. We were able to produce results similar to those predicted by ODT when social neighborhoods were local and overlapping. These results suggest that the effectiveness of a social identity decision strategy is highly dependent on sociospatial structure.},

Similar phenomena are central to crowd control, cleaning the environment and other engineering problems. Despite single dogs solving this {\textquoteleft}shepherding problem{\textquoteright} every day, it remains unknown which algorithm they employ or whether a general algorithm exists for shepherding. Here, we demonstrate such an algorithm, based on adaptive switching between collecting the agents when they are too dispersed and driving them once they are aggregated. Our algorithm reproduces key features of empirical data collected from sheep{\textendash}dog interactions and suggests new ways in which robots can be designed to influence movements of living and artificial agents.},

This study has proved itself uniquely interdisciplinary, involving physicists, mathematicians, engineers as well as biologists. Almost all experimental work in this area is related directly or indirectly to mathematical models, with regular movement back and forth between models, experimental data and statistical fitting. In this paper, we describe how the modelling cycle works in the study of collective animal behaviour. We classify studies as addressing questions at different levels or linking different levels, i.e. as local, local to global, global to local or global. We also describe three distinct approaches{\textemdash}theory-driven, data-driven and model selection{\textemdash}to these questions. We show, with reference to our own research on species across different taxa, how we move between these different levels of description and how these various approaches can be applied to link levels together.},

 abstract = {In an experiment investigating the impact of preweaning social experience on later social behavior in pigs, we were interested in the mutual spatial positions of pigs during paired social interactions. To obtain these data, we applied a different colored mark to the head and back of each of 2 pigs per group and videotaped the pigs' interactions. We used the EthoVision tracking system to provide x,y coordinates of the four colored marks every 0.2 sec. This paper describes the structure and functioning of a FoxPro program designed to clean the raw data and use it to identify the mutual body positions of the 2 animals at 0.2-sec intervals. Cleaning the data was achieved by identifying invalid data points and replacing them by interpolations. An algorithm was then applied to extract three variables from the coordinates: (1) whether the two pigs were in body contact; (2) the mutual orientation (parallel, antiparallel, or perpendicular) of the two pigs; and (3) whether the pig in the "active" position made snout contact in front of, or behind, the ear base of the other pig. Using these variables, we were able to identify five interaction types: Pig A attacks, Pig B attacks, undecided head-to-head position, "clinch" resting position, or no contact. To assess the reliability of the automatic system, a randomly chosen 5-min videotaped interaction was scored for mutual positions both visually (by 2 independent observers) and automatically. Good agreement was found between the data from the 2 observers and between each observer's data and the data from the automated system, as assessed using Cohen's kappa coefficients.},

@article{togashi-2018-cdyn,
 abstract = {Purpose It is of paramount importance to ensure safe and fast evacuation routes in cities in case of natural disasters, environmental accidents or acts of terrorism. The same applies to large-scale events such as concerts, sport events and religious pilgrimages as airports and to traffic hubs such as airports and train stations. The prediction of pedestrian is notoriously difficult because it varies depending on circumstances (age group, cultural characteristics, etc.). In this study, the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation technique, which uses the updated observation data to improve the accuracy of the simulation, was applied to improve the accuracy of numerical simulations of pedestrian flow. Design/methodology/approach The EnKF, one of the data assimilation techniques, was applied to the in-house numerical simulation code for pedestrian flow. Two cases were studied in this study. One was the simplified one-directional experimental pedestrian flow. The other was the real pedestrian flow at the Kaaba in Mecca. First, numerical simulations were conducted using the empirical input parameter sets. Then, using the observation data, the EnKF estimated the appropriate input parameter sets. Finally, the numerical simulations using the estimated parameter sets were conducted. Findings The EnKF worked on the numerical simulations of pedestrian flow very effectively. In both cases: simplified experiment and real pedestrian flow, the EnKF estimated the proper input parameter sets which greatly improved the accuracy of the numerical simulation. The authors believe that the technique such as EnKF could also be used effectively in other fields of computational engineering where simulations and data have to be merged. Practical implications This technique can be used to improve both design and operational implementations of pedestrian and crowd dynamics predictions. It should be of high interest to command and control centers for large crowd events such as concerts, airports, train stations and pilgrimage centers. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, the data assimilation technique has not been applied to a numerical simulation of pedestrian flow, especially to the real pedestrian flow handling millions pedestrian such as the Mataf at the Kaaba. This study validated the capability and the usefulness of the data assimilation technique to numerical simulations for pedestrian flow.},

The analysis is done in controllable systems where the density is homogeneous and all the characteristics are known. The objectives are to estimate the global density with local measurements or density profile at high spatial resolution with no bias and low fluctuations. The classical estimation using discrete numbers of observed pedestrians is compared to continuous estimators using spacing distance, Voronoi diagram, Gaussian kernel as well as maximum likelihood. Mean squared error and bias of the estimators are calculated from empirical data and Monte Carlo experiments. The results show quantitatively how continuous approaches improve the precision of the estimations.},

 abstract = {Animal groups in nature often display an enhanced collective information-processing capacity. It has been speculated that natural selection will tune this response to be optimal, ensuring that the group is reactive while also being robust to noise. Here, we show that this is unlikely to be the case. By using a simple model of decision-making in a dynamic environment, we find that when individuals behave rationally and are subject to selection based on their accuracy, optimality of collective decision-making is not attained. Instead, individuals overly rely on social information and evolve to be too readily influenced by their neighbours. This is due to a classic evolutionary conflict between individual and collective interest. The result is a sub-optimal system that is poised on the cusp of total unresponsiveness. Individuals in the evolved group exhibit delayed reactions to changes in the environment, before responding with rapid, socially reinforced transitions, reminiscent of familiar human and animal social systems (markets, stampedes, fashions, etc.). Our results demonstrate that behaviour of this type may not be pathological, but instead could represent an evolutionary attractor for such collective systems.},

@mastersthesis{tuna-2008-cdyn,
 abstract = {The most important factor determining exchange times is passenger behaviour which is influenced by traveller characteristics, like age and / or mobility constrictions, the amount of luggage and finally the vehicle's design. On days with high passenger-frequencies prolonged passenger exchange time results in extensive stop-over time. This leads to delays, which can also influence other trains and therefore cause further delays. Any delay reduces customer satisfaction, which, on the other hand, shifts modal split to the disadvantage of public transport. For the investigation of the passenger exchange time multiple data collections were necessary, which were done in summer 2007 in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Video recording and analysis was used to determine exact passenger's time requirements, behaviour in tailbacks and general behaviour. Approximately 3800 descending and 7400 boarding passengers were evaluated. Passenger exchange can be divided into two parts. Ten to fifteen persons describe the passenger exchange at a single door and through an entrance area. This number allows to look at the tailback, which arises directly at the single door or the entrance area. The main parameters in both cases are the agility of the passenger, the luggage, the number of steps and the door width. These factors are described and quantified on the basis of significant analysis. For the passenger exchange relating to the coach's interior the number of travellers is not limited to fifteen. The amount of luggage plays a major role also in the vehicle's interior, concering to the aisle{\textquoteright}NAs width and the passing points. Arrangement and numbers of doors per coach are also fundamental factors
Stop-over time can be reduced to a third of the present one by optimisation of the vehicle and the harmonisation of the vehicle and the platform edge.},

 abstract = {For mobile robots which operate in human populated 
environments, modeling social interactions is key to understand and 
reproduce people'sbehavior. A promising approach to this end is Inverse 
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) as it allows to model the factors that motivate 
people's actions instead of the actions themselves. A crucial design choice
in IRL is the selection of features that encode the agent's
context. In related work, features are typically chosen ad hoc
without systematic evaluation of the alternatives and their
actual impact on the robot's task. In this paper, we introduce a
new software framework to systematically investigate the effect
features and learning algorithms used in the literature. We
also present results for the task of socially compliant robot
navigation in crowds, evaluating two different IRL approaches
and several feature sets in large-scale simulations. The results
are benchmarked according to a proposed set of objective and
subjective performance metrics.},

 abstract = {We review the observations and the basic laws describing the essential aspects of collective motion -- being one of the most common and spectacular manifestation of coordinated behavior. Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion of the various facets of this highly multidisciplinary field, including experiments, mathematical methods and models for simulations, so that readers with a variety of background could get both the basics and a broader, more detailed picture of the field. The observations we report on include systems consisting of units ranging from macromolecules through metallic rods and robots to groups of animals and people. Some emphasis is put on models that are simple and realistic enough to reproduce the numerous related observations and are useful for developing concepts for a better understanding of the complexity of systems consisting of many simultaneously moving entities. As such, these models allow the establishing of a few fundamental principles of flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated, that in spite of considerable differences, a number of deep analogies exist between equilibrium statistical physics systems and those made of self-propelled (in most cases living) units. In both cases only a few well defined macroscopic/collective states occur and the transitions between these states follow a similar scenario, involving discontinuity and algebraic divergences.},

 abstract = {Transfer organization of public transportation terminals has played a more important role in urban transportation management and planning. The micro-simulation software, VISSIM, is designed to model the pedestrian transfer in the Xizhimen Public Transportation Terminal (Beijing, China) in this paper. Four problems are found in the case study: severe disturbance between pedestrians and traffic flows, long transfer distances, bus waiting time and great traffic flow density. The paper proposes some measures for the solution to the problems, such as increasing the departure frequency of buses, building the crossing-street infrastructure for pedestrians, shortening transfer distances. The simulation result shows that the proposed methods in this paper are valuable in improving the efficiency of the transfer organizations of the Xizhimen Public Transportation Terminal (Beijing, China).},

 abstract = {The combination of multi-agent technology and reinforcement learning methods has been recognized as an effective way which used in path planning based crowd simulation. However, existing solution is still not satisfactory due to the problem in the mutual influence of agents. Therefore, an improved multi-agent reinforcement learning method (IMARL algorithm) is introduced. In this method, the intersection of the pedestrian trajectory extracted from the real video is first used as the state space for reinforcement learning. The crowd is grouped and the leader is selected. A bulletin board is added to the reinforcement learning algorithm of multi-agent to store the empirical knowledge of the learning process, and the navigation agent passes information between the leader and the bulletin board. The original social force modelwas improved, and the cohesive force of visual factors was added to the force formula. The IMARL algorithm is combined with the improved social force model for crowd evacuation simulation. Using a two-layer control mechanism, the leader in the upper layer uses the decision process based on the IMARL algorithm to select the path, and the individuals in the bottom group use the improved social force model to evacuate. The method of this paper not only solves the dimensionality disaster problem of reinforcement learning, but also improves the convergence speed. The evacuation efficiency is effectively improved in crowd evacuation simulation experiments. In addition, it also can provide specific guidance scheme for crowd evacuation improvement and assistant decision support for the prevention and management of large-scale group trampling incidents.},

Subsequently, the microscopic simulation was executed, by which the emergence of complex crowd behavior is reproduced, such as lane formation and fundamental diagram was compared with the existing studies.

 abstract = {We present a model of overtaking behavior that can be used to simulate unidirectional pedestrian flow in routine. All pedestrians have the ability to determine whether or not to overtake other pedestrians according to their desired velocity and position. Although existing models such as cellular automata models, lattice gas models, social force models, etc., can be used to predict evacuation performance, most of these models are either computationally inefficient or do not account for some crucial elements of human behavior in a moving crowd. Furthermore, these models use either empirical equations developed from experiments or mechanical system analogies to determine movement decisions. The pedestrian flow patterns simulated by these models may deviate significantly from reality. In reality, pedestrians walk at different velocities and pedestrians with a higher walking velocity are accustomed to overtaking other pedestrians with a lower walking velocity and this paper aims to mimic this behavior as the original social force model developed by Helbing et al. does not reflect this pattern of collective pedestrian behavior. In this paper, we propose modifications of the social force model that reflects how overtaking behavior operates in routine. The comparison of the pedestrian flow pattern between the original social force model and the modified social force models with the real data collected by the camcorder is also performed in order to demonstrate our modified social force model can be used to achieve reasonable simulations of overtaking behavior among pedestrians.},

 abstract = {Many observations of pedestrian dynamics, including various self-organization phenomena, have been reproduced successfully by different models. But the empirical databases for quantitative calibration are still insufficient, e.g. the fundamental diagram as one of the most important relationships displays non-negligible differences among various studies. To improve this situation, experiments in straight corridors and T-junctions are performed. Four different measurement methods are defined to study their effects on the fundamental diagram. It is shown that they have minor influences for rho < 3.5^m-2 but only the Voronoi method is able to resolve the fine structure of the fundamental diagram. This enhanced measurement method permits us to observe the occurrence of a boundary-induced phase transition. For corridors of different widths we found that the specific flow concept works well for rho < 3.5^m-2 . Moreover, we illustrate the discrepancies between the fundamental diagrams of a T-junction and a straight corridor.},

A circumstance potential field was defined to simulate the desire to targets. Moving and waiting potential fields were defined to model the interaction. Experiments were run for the model validation and coefficient performance verification. Performances and relationships of sensitivity coefficient, decay coefficient and diffusion coefficient are studied to clarify the effectiveness and flexibility of the presented model in generating pedestrian movement under a variety of situations. The simulation results show the good performance of the model in reflecting pedestrian interactive behavior.},

Recently, dynamic floor fields were introduced which adapt to changes in geometry and the density of crowds. They significantly increase the realism of floor field-based simulations. However, the computation of floor fields is time consuming. In case of multiple or dynamic floor fields, which require frequent recomputations, the total simulation run time is dominated by their computation. We present an algorithm to construct floor fields for continuous space models that uses unstructured meshes. Due to the geometrical flexibility of unstructured meshes, our method reduces the computational complexity by using fewer but well-positioned mesh points.},

 abstract = {Active colloids are microscopic particles, which self-propel through viscous fluids by converting energy extracted from their environment into directed motion. We first explain how artificial microswimmers move forward by generating near-surface flow fields via self-phoresis or the self-induced Marangoni effect. We then discuss generic features of the dynamics of single active colloids in bulk and in confinement, as well as in the presence of gravity, field gradients, and fluid flow. In the third section, we review the emergent collective behavior of active colloidal suspensions, focusing on their structural and dynamic properties. After summarizing experimental observations, we give an overview of the progress in modeling collectively moving active colloids. While active Brownian particles are heavily used to study collective dynamics on large scales, more advanced methods are necessary to explore the importance of hydrodynamic and phoretic particle interactions. Finally, the relevant physical approaches to quantify the emergent collective behavior are presented.},

 abstract = {Crowd safety is a major concern for those attending and managing mass gatherings, such as the annual Hajj or pilgrimage to Mecca (also called Makkah). One threat to crowd safety at such events is crowd density. However, recent research also suggests that psychological membership of crowds can have positive benefits. We tested the hypothesis that the effect of density on safety might vary depending on whether there is shared social identification in the crowd. We surveyed 1,194 pilgrims at the Holy Mosque, Mecca, during the 2012 Hajj. Analysis of the data showed that the negative effect of crowd density on reported safety was moderated by social identification with the crowd. Whereas low identifiers reported reduced safety with greater crowd density, high identifiers reported increased safety with greater crowd density. Mediation analysis suggested that a reason for these moderation effects was the perception that other crowd members were supportive. Differences in reported safety across national groups (Arab countries and Iran compared with the rest) were also explicable in terms of crowd identification and perceived support. These findings support a social identity account of crowd behavior and offer a novel perspective on crowd safety management.},

Each lane is modeled by a deterministic TASEP (totally asymmetric exclusion process). The particles enter and leave lane \sigma (where \sigma = 1, 2) with probabilities \alpha \sigma and \beta \sigma , respectively. We employ the 'frozen shuffle' update introduced in earlier work (Appert-Rolland et al 2011 J. Stat. Mech. P07009), in which the particle positions are updated in a fixed random order. We find analytically that each lane may be in a 'free flow' or in a 'jammed' state. Hence the phase diagram in the domain 0 \leq \alpha 1, \alpha 2 \leq 1 consists of four regions with boundaries depending on \beta 1 and \beta 2 . The regions meet in a single point on the diagonal of the domain. Our analytical predictions for the phase boundaries as well as for the currents and densities in each phase are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.},

In the frame of the PEDIGREE project, trajectories of pedestrians walking along a one-dimensional path were tracked through a high-precision motion capture. Data analysis allowed to obtain the fundamental diagram at different scales. Two unexpected transitions in the way pedestrians follow each other have been evidenced. The interest of the experiment is to capture at the same time microscopic and macroscopic characteristics of the flow. Indeed, macroscopic structures such as stop-and-go waves can also be studied from the data. Eventually, a data-based following model has been proposed. Its calibration/validation can be performed both at the microscopic or macroscopic level. It is possible to extend the model to quasi-one-dimensional flows for the modeling of pedestrian flows in corridors.},

Stat. Phys. 141, 829 (2010)]. In this paper, we analyze the dynamical properties of the number of particles Nt and the position of the last particle (the system length) Lt, using an analytical method (generating function technique) as well as a phenomenological description based on domain-wall dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The system exhibits two phases corresponding to linear convergence or divergence of Nt and Lt. These phases can both further be subdivided into high-density and maximal-current subphases. The predictions of the domain-wall theory are found to be in very good agreement quantitively with results from Monte Carlo simulations in the convergent phase. On the other hand, in the divergent phase, only the prediction for Nt agrees with simulations.},

Here we consider two discrete-time versions of the EQP with parallel and backward-sequential update rules. The phase diagram (with respect to the arrival probability alpha and the service probability beta ) is divided into two phases corresponding to divergence and convergence of the system length. We investigate the behavior on the critical line separating these phases. For both update rules, we find diffusive behavior for small service probability (beta < beta_c). . However, for beta > beta_c it becomes sub-diffusive and nonuniversal: the critical exponents characterizing the divergence of the system length and the number of customers are found to depend on the update rule. For the backward-update case, they also depend on the hopping parameter p , and remain finite when p is large, indicating a first-order transition.},

 abstract = {Cockroaches were observed with videographic methods as escape running was initiated, but with obstacles in the path of their run. The goal was to determine the repertoire of possible responses to obstacles and the sensory cues used to trigger the responses. Intact cockroaches collided with obstacles on only about 10% of trials. The most common collision avoidance strategy was simply to stop running prior to impact. However, occasionally animals moved vertically and climbed over the barrier, or turned and navigated an edge of the obstacle, or completely reversed run direction. The avoidance strategies chosen depended on the size and configuration of the obstacle. Tests for the use of vision in detecting obstacles showed that its role, if any, is small. However, all manipulations that altered the antennal system changed behavior in a way consistent with the hypothesis that antennal mechanosensation plays a major role in collision avoidance. For example, reducing antennal length, or severing the main antennal nerve without altering the length produced significant increases in the frequency of collisions. Tests with tethered insects showed that (1) the antennae are preferentially directed forward as animals run, and (2) nearly simultaneous contact with both antennae is required to make the cockroach stop. Our data indicate that running cockroaches employ strategies that set their sensorimotor systems in a mode of readiness to deal with obstacles and they suggest that sensory information about the presence and configuration of obstacles is used to make choices, at very short latencies, about how to respond to obstructions.},

 abstract = {Interventions of central, top-down planning are serious limitations to the possibility of modelling the dynamics of cities. An example is the city of Paris (France), which during the 19th century experienced large modifications supervised by a central authority, the 'Haussmann period'. In this article, we report an empirical analysis of more than 200 years (1789-2010) of the evolution of the street network of Paris. We show that the usual network measures display a smooth behavior and that the most important quantitative signatures of central planning is the spatial reorganization of centrality and the modification of the block shape distribution. Such effects can only be obtained by structural modifications at a large-scale level, with the creation of new roads not constrained by the existing geometry. The evolution of a city thus seems to result from the superimposition of continuous, local growth processes and punctual changes operating at large spatial scales.},

crowd dynamics, pointing on the one hand to insights into the complexity features of
pedestrian flows and on the other hand to a critical overview of the most popular modeling
approaches currently adopted in the specialized literature. Particularly, the focus is
on scaling problems, namely representation and modeling at microscopic, macroscopic,
and mesoscopic scales, which, entangled with the complexity issues of living systems,
generate multiscale dynamical effects, such as e.g. self-organization. Mathematical structures
suitable to approach such multiscale aspects are proposed, along with a forward
look at research developments.},

 comment = {<note author="gk"> State of the art from 2012, from a purely differential equation perspective: social forces for microscopic models and fluid dynamics for macroscopic models. CA or agent-models or network flow models have completely escaped the authors' notice as mathematical models. The authors add a probability distribution to both approaches of which I have not understood the use. Then a model is presented that considers peds as particles with activity states that are randomly distributed to model different walking ability. This follows ideas from kinetic theory.\n What I liked: The search for and understanding of appropriate mathematical structures to model crowd dynamics is seen as a task in itself. Empirical information is seen as the source of inspiration to find such mathematical structures beyond being a means to calibrate and validate. Calibration and validation are seen as we do it in our group. "Models have to produce, at least at a qualitative level, emerging phenomena which are observed in real situations, including the sensitivity to environmental conditions". "Upscaling microscopic information to the macroscopic level without relying one purely phenomenological guesses" is recognized as a crucial problem \n\n Criticisms: \n The kinetic model is not intuitive. Validation of it is not discussed in this paper. The authors use panic in a sense that modern psychology would reject, especially making claims on how panicky agents act that are not based on empirical findings from psychology. </note>},

The greatest difficulties to any scientific approach to cities have resulted from their many interdependent facets, as social, economic, infrastructural, and spatial complex systems that exist in similar but changing forms over a huge range of scales. Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies.},

  abstract = {Despite considerable interest among engineers and scientists, bi-directional interaction between walking pedestrians and lively bridges has still not been well understood. In an attempt to bridge this gap a biomechanically inspired model of the human response to lateral bridge motion is presented and explored. The simple inverted pendulum model captures the key features of pedestrian lateral balance and the resulting forces on the structure. The forces include self-excited components that can be effectively modelled as frequency-dependent added damping and mass to the structure. The results of numerical simulations are in reasonable agreement with recent experimental measurements of humans walking on a laterally oscillating treadmill, and in very good agreement with measurements on full-scale bridges. In contrast to many other models of lateral pedestrian loading, synchronisation with the bridge motion is not involved. A parametric study of the model is conducted, revealing that as pedestrians slow down as a crowd becomes more dense, their resulting lower pacing rates generate larger self-excited forces. For typical pedestrian parameters, the potential to generate negative damping arises for any lateral bridge vibration frequency above 0.43 Hz, depending on the walking frequency. Stability boundaries of the combined pedestrian-structure system are presented in terms of the structural damping ratio and pedestrian-to-bridge mass ratio, revealing complex relations between damping demand and bridge and pedestrian frequencies, due to the added mass effect. Finally it is demonstrated that the model can produce simultaneous self-excited forces on multiple structural modes, and a realistic full simulation of a large number of pedestrians, walking randomly and interacting with a bridge, produces structural behaviour in very good agreement with site observations.},

 abstract = {The mechanism of self-organization resulting in coordinated collective motion has received wide attention from a range of scientists interested in both its technical and biological relevance. Models have been highly influential in highlighting how collective motion can be produced from purely local interactions between individuals. Typical models in this field are termed {\textquoteleft}metric{\textquoteright} because each individual only reacts to conspecifics within a fixed distance. A recent large-scale study has, however, provided evidence that interactions ruling collective behaviour occur between a fixed number of nearest neighbours ({\textquoteleft}topological{\textquoteright} framework). Despite their importance in clarifying the nature of the mechanism underlying animal interactions, these findings have yet to be produced by either metric or topological models. Here, we present an original individual-based model of collective animal motion that reproduces the previous findings. Our approach bridges the current gap between previous model analysis and recent evidence, and presents a framework for further study.},

How such preferences could affect the collective motion of animal groups has been rather unexplored. We present a general model of collective animal motion that includes social connections as preferential reactions between individuals. Our conceptual examples illustrate the possible impact of underlying social networks on the collective motion of animals. Our approach shows that the structure of these networks could influence: (1) the cohesion of groups; (2) the spatial position of individuals within groups; and (3) the hierarchical dynamics within such groups. We argue that the position of individuals within a social network and the social network structure of populations could have important fitness implications for individual animals. Counterintuitive results from our conceptual examples show that social structures can result in unexpected group dynamics. This sharpens our understanding of the way in which collective movement can be interpreted as a result of social interactions.},

 abstract = {Recent models from theoretical physics have predicted that mass-migrating animal groups may share group-level properties, irrespective of the type of animals in the group. One key prediction is that as the density of animals in the group increases, a rapid transition occurs from disordered movement of individuals within the group to highly aligned collective motion. Understanding such a transition is crucial to the control of mobile swarming insect pests such as the desert locust. We confirmed the prediction of a rapid transition from disordered to ordered movement and identified a critical density for the onset of coordinated marching in locust nymphs. We also demonstrated a dynamic instability in motion at densities typical of locusts in the field, in which groups can switch direction without external perturbation, potentially facilitating the rapid transfer of directional information.},

Its great versatility and flexibility has led to many attempts at building walking machines with similar capabilities. The control of walking is an active research area both in neurobiology and robotics, with a large and growing body of work. This paper gives an overview of the current knowledge on the control of legged locomotion in animals and machines and attempts to give walking control researchers from biology and robotics an overview of the current knowledge in both fields. We try to summarize the knowledge on the neurobiological basis of walking control in animals, emphasizing common principles seen in different species. In a section on walking robots, we review common approaches to walking controller design with a slight emphasis on biped walking control. We show where parallels between robotic and neurobiological walking controllers exist and how robotics and biology may benefit from each other. Finally, we discuss where research in the two fields diverges and suggest ways to bridge these gaps.},

  abstract = {Much of the guidance available to engineers regarding human-induced bridge vibration and the lateral instability phenomenon that can occur has resulted from experience of 'one-off' bridge loading events such as the London Millennium and Paris Solf\'{e}rino bridges. This has resulted in restrictive design criteria for pedestrian numbers and acceleration limits. However, this area has been the subject of extensive research over more than a decade. As a consequence, improved understanding of the problem has enabled the development of better modelling and simulation tools. In this paper, human-induced vibration is considered from two viewpoints, (i) the interaction that takes place between individual walking pedestrians and the vibrating bridge, and (ii) the wider crowd behaviour that results from the interactions between pedestrians. The current state of the art is identified in each area and a modelling framework is presented that couples both. A discrete element crowd model is coupled with a dynamical system. The dynamical system models interaction between multiple inverted pendulum (IP) biomechanical models and a SDoF system representing a bridge vibration mode. Both the crowd model and dynamical system are coupled in a time-stepping framework with crowd model output used to update the dynamical system at each time-step. The model is then used to simulate the multi-modal response of the Clifton Suspension Bridge (CSB), previously documented in the literature. Model predictions show good agreement with observations from the CSB. Most notably, lateral instability develops in a mode at 0.52 Hz followed by instability in a second at 0.75 Hz, without step frequency tuning among the crowd, in line with observations. Furthermore, the model suggests that instability in mode L2 may have lead directly to development of instability in mode L3. The existence of a feedback mechanism has been confirmed and is identified as resulting from amplitude modulation of the lateral ground reaction force. This mechanism results from alteration of the lateral position of the foot in successive steps in response to base oscillations.},

 abstract = {Simulating traffic flow is an important problem in transport planning. The most popular simulation approaches for large-scale scenarios today are aggregated models. Unfortunately, these models lack temporal and spatial resolution. But microsimulations are interesting for traffic flow simulation, as they can accurately simulate features requiring both high temporal and high spatial resolution, including traffic jams and peak periods. However, most microscopic approaches involve high computational costs and expensive large computers to run them within a reasonable time. This work presents possibilities for reducing these costs by using a queue-based model and an event-driven approach jointly. The approach makes it possible to run large-scale scenarios with more than 1 million simulated person-days on networks with 10,000 links in less than 10 min on single CPU desktop computers present in most offices today.},

As such models are applied e.g.\ in evacuation studies, the quality and reliability of such models is of vital interest. Pedestrian trajectories are functional data and thus functional principal component analysis is a natural tool to asses the quality of pedestrian flow models beyond average properties. In this article we conduct functional PCA for the trajectories of pedestrians passing through a bottleneck. We benchmark two agent based models of pedestrian flow against the experimental data using PCA average and stochastic features. Functional PCA proves to be an efficient tool to detect deviation between simulation and experiment and to asses quality of pedestrian models.},

 abstract = {It probably happened to everyone that they travelled in a train and had to spend the trip in a completely overcrowded railcar. However these overcrowded railcars still offer some free seats, that are not taken although there are many people searching for a place to sit. This papers intent is to find the reasons why these seats are not being used by passengers. Data material of about 160 trains, 1.900 railcars, 49.300 travellers and 50.600 pieces of luggage was obtained by videotaping in the trains. The biggest attention is turned to the passenger's behaviour depending on the different degree of efficiency. Therefore numerous information regarding the passenger - age, gender, size of the preferred travel group - as well as the different railcar types where this behaviour is shown is relevant. Therefore chapter 2 and 3 of this paper deal with the passenger behaviour and the surveyed railcar types. This is followed by a breakdown of the different options regarding the choice of a seat that a passenger has to decide on in chapter 4. Travellers have the choice of sitting in or against travel direction, on a window-, middle- or corridor-seat as well as the choice of the preferred area. The selection of a Compartment car or Saloon coach, seating in rows or Vis-{\a`a}-vis offer many different options. The basic behaviour is furthermore influenced by different factors like the amount of luggage and edge conditions like the capacity utilisation within the railcar. Chapter 5 covers the behaviour of the passengers that is also dependent on the layout of the railcar. Constructional differences cause different behaviour. The proportion of available compartment, Vis-{\a`a}-vis - and row seats has a substantial influence just like the availability and placement of luggage racks or the size and placement of tables in seating groups. Finally chapter 6 and 7 deal with the comparison of different railcar types regarding their seat degree of efficiency and the opportunities to enhance the overall degree of efficiency in railcars.},

 abstract = {Mathematical modelling of the movement of animals, micro-organisms and cells is of great relevance in the fields of biology, ecology and medicine. Movement models can take many different forms, but the most widely used are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.},

 abstract = {Humans tend to swing their arms when they walk, a curious behaviour since the arms play no obvious role in bipedal gait. It might be costly to use muscles to swing the arms, and it is unclear whether potential benefits elsewhere in the body would justify such costs. To examine these costs and benefits, we developed a passive dynamic walking model with free-swinging arms. Even with no torques driving the arms or legs, the model produced walking gaits with arm swinging similar to humans. Passive gaits with arm phasing opposite to normal were also found, but these induced a much greater reaction moment from the ground, which could require muscular effort in humans. We therefore hypothesized that the reduction of this moment may explain the physiological benefit of arm swinging. Experimental measurements of humans (n = 10) showed that normal arm swinging required minimal shoulder torque, while volitionally holding the arms still required 12 per cent more metabolic energy. Among measures of gait mechanics, vertical ground reaction moment was most affected by arm swinging and increased by 63 per cent without it. Walking with opposite-to-normal arm phasing required minimal shoulder effort but magnified the ground reaction moment, causing metabolic rate to increase by 26 per cent. Passive dynamics appear to make arm swinging easy, while indirect benefits from reduced vertical moments make it worthwhile overall.},

Under these circumstances individuals may be susceptible to manipulation by a strongly opinionated, or extremist, minority. It has previously been argued, for humans and animals, that social groups containing individuals who are uninformed, or exhibit weak preferences, are particularly vulnerable to such manipulative agents. Here, we use theory and experiment to demonstrate that, for a wide range of conditions, a strongly opinionated minority can dictate group choice, but the presence of uninformed individuals spontaneously inhibits this process, returning control to the numerical majority. Our results emphasize the role of uninformed individuals in achieving democratic consensus amid internal group conflict and informational constraints.},

 abstract = {This article presents a new simulation approach for multidestination pedestrian crowds in
complex environments. The work covers two major topics. In the first part, a novel cellular automaton (CA)
model is proposed. The model describes the pedestrian movement by a set of simple rules and produces fundamental
diagrams similar to those derived from laboratory experiments. The second topic of this work describes how
the CA can be integrated into an iterative learning cycle where the individual pedestrian can adapt travel plans
based on experiences from previous iterations. Depending on the setup, the overall travel behavior moves either
toward a Nash equilibrium or the system optimum. The functional interaction of the CA with the iterative
learning approach is demonstrated on a set of transport paradoxes. Furthermore, time series of speed and density
observed in a small-scale experiment show a general agreement between the CA simulation and laboratory experiments.
The scalability of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a large-scale scenario.},

 abstract = {For moving animals, the successful avoidance of hazardous obstacles is an important capability. Despite this, few models of collective motion have addressed the relationship between behavioural and social features and obstacle avoidance. We develop an asynchronous individual-based model for social movement which allows social structure within groups to be included. We assess the dynamics of group navigation and resulting collision risk in the context of information transfer through the system. In agreement with previous work, we find that group size has a nonlinear effect on collision risk. We implement examples of possible network structures to explore the impact social preferences have on collision risk. We show that any social heterogeneity induces greater obstacle avoidance with further improvements corresponding to groups containing fewer influential individuals. The model provides a platform for both further theoretical investigation and practical application. In particular, we argue that the role of social structures within bird flocks may have an important role to play in assessing the risk of collisions with wind turbines, but that new methods of data analysis are needed to identify these social structures.},

 abstract = {The value of a pedestrian stream simulation depends on its ability to reproduce natural behaviour of pedestrians in different situations. Most models assume that pedestrians are single-minded and constantly move towards their destinations. However, our observa- tions at two major German railway stations made during field experiments and our anal- ysis of video recordings at one of these stations revealed that in virtually every setting a significant proportion of pedestrians do not walk continuously. Instead, they occasionally change their route in order to visit certain locations and stand there for a period of time. By waiting, they often block walking pedestrians and thereby influence the overall dynam- ics. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of waiting pedestrians and propose a model for waiting pedestrians based on cellular automata. The model is able to reproduce the observed pedestrian behaviour. We illustrate the model with simulations of several real life scenarios for a major German railway station and show that during rush hour standing pedestrians may prolong walking time by up to nearly 20%. We also demonstrate how the developed model can be used for the analysis of infrastructures, and prediction of prob- lematic areas in public spaces.},

  abstract = {A common assumption regarding mass emergency situations is that individuals in such contexts behave in a way that maximizes their likelihood to escape, at the expense, or with little concern for, the welfare and survival of their neighbors. Doing so, they might even compromise the effectiveness of group evacuation. This conception follows the views of early works on crowd psychology, a tradition born with Gustave Le Bon's The Crowd: a study of the Popular Mind, first published in 1895, and which has had a tremendous impact on scientific representations of people's behavior in mass emergency contexts. Indeed, this work has greatly contributed to the idea that, in such situations, people revert to a primitive, impulsive, irrational, and antisocial nature, causing the breakdown of social order. However, more empirically oriented studies have consistently reported little collective panic, as well as a great deal of solidarity and pro-social behavior during mass emergency situations. Because of institutional barriers, such views have remained largely unknown to cognitive psychologists. Yet these are important results in that they show that human individual and collective reactions to threat are primarily affiliative. Indeed, far from leading to the breakdown of the social fabrics, the presence of a common threat can strengthen social bonds},

 abstract = {This paper provides a critical review on the state-of-the-art pedestrian and evacuation dynamics so as to comprehensively comprehend the motion behaviors of pedestrians from observations to simulation aspects. Types of typical data collection methods, namely the field survey, the controlled experiment, and the animal experiment, are classified, and the connections and differences of these three observation methods are explored. Pedestrians' complex behaviors characterized by the self-organization phenomena and movement data characterized by the fundamental diagram are then studied after the data collections, which can be used to calibrate and validate the pedestrian models. The mathematical models for pedestrian dynamics from both tactical level and operational level are also highlighted. The simulation data produced by the mathematical models could further reproduce pedestrian behaviors during the observations and contribute to decision makings for improving the evacuation efficiency. The applications of pedestrian models for behavior analysis, evacuation simulation, and layout design are also presented.

 abstract = {This paper situates contemporary social scientific studies of crowd events and crowd behaviour in their historical and ideological context. The original crowd science developed from definitions of social problems that emerged in the late nineteenth century in particular the concerns among the French establishment about the threat of the mass to civilization. This, and the surrounding intellectual context, encouraged the development of theoretical models of the crowd characterized by forms of reductionism and irrationalism. Early accounts of mass panic similarly suggested that collective behaviour was irrational because it was governed by primitive bio-psychological processes. After describing these early approaches to the crowd, the paper outlines how changes in late twentieth society, whereby those writing about the crowd were no longer necessarily outside crowd events, have coincided with the development of accounts of the crowd which draw upon contemporary social scientific concepts (such as social norms, social identities, and cognition) and which assume that crowds are not alien to meaningful social and political participation, but integral to it.},

 abstract = {Currently, pedestrian simulation models are used to predict where, when and why hazardous high density crowd movements arise. However, it is questionable whether models developed for low density situations can be used to simulate high density crowd movements. The objective of this paper is to assess the existent pedestrian simulation models with respect to known crowd phenomena in order to ascertain whether these models can indeed be used for the simulation of high density crowds and to indicate any gaps in the field of pedestrian simulation modeling research. This paper provides a broad, but not exhaustive overview of the crowd motion simulation models of the last decades. It is argued that any model used for crowd simulation should be able to simulate most of the phenomena indicated in this paper. In the paper cellular automata, social force models, velocity-based models, continuum models, hybrid models, behavioral models and network models are discussed. The comparison shows that the models can roughly be divided into slow but highly precise microscopic modeling attempts and very fast but behaviorally questionable macroscopic modeling attempts. Both sets of models have their use, which is highly dependent on the application the model has originally been developed for. Yet, for practical applications, that need both precision and speed, the current pedestrian simulation models are inadequate.},

  abstract = {In groups of animals only a small proportion of individuals may possess particular information, such as a migration route or the direction to a resource. Individuals may differ in preferred direction resulting in conflicts of interest and, therefore, consensus decisions may have to be made to prevent the group from splitting. Recent theoretical work has shown how leadership and consensus decision making can occur without active signalling or individual recognition. Here we test these predictions experimentally using humans. We found that a small informed minority could guide a group of na\"ive individuals to a target without verbal communication or obvious signalling. Both the time to target and deviation from target were decreased by the presence of informed individuals. When conflicting directional information was given to different group members, the time taken to reach the target was not significantly increased; suggesting that consensus decision making in conflict situations is possible, and highly efficient. Where there was imbalance in the number of informed individuals with conflicting information, the majority dictated group direction. Our results also suggest that the spatial starting position of informed individuals influences group motion, which has implications in terms of crowd control and planning for evacuations.},

 abstract = {A one-dimensional driven lattice gas with disorder in the particle hopping probabilities is considered. It has previously been shown that in the version of the model with random sequential updating, a phase transition occurs from a low-density inhomogeneous phase to a high-density congested phase. Here the steady states for both parallel (fully synchronous) updating and ordered sequential updating are solved exactly. The phase transition is shown to persist in both cases with the critical densities being higher than that for random sequential dynamics. The steady-state velocities are related to the fugacity of a Bose system suggesting a principle of minimization of velocity. A generalization of the dynamics, to the case where the hopping probabilities depend on the number of empty sites in front of the particles, is also solved exactly in the case of parallel updating. The models have natural interpretations as simplistic descriptions of traffic flow. The relation to more sophisticated traffic flow models is discussed.},

 abstract = {Social information use is common in a wide range of group-living animals, notably in humans. We investigated social information use by pedestrians in a potentially dangerous scenario: at a road crossing. To judge a safe gap in traffic, pedestrians can use social information, such as the crossing behavior of others, and follow others across the road. We tested if pedestrians followed others in this scenario by analyzing pedestrian starting position and crossing order. First, we found that neighbors of a crossing pedestrian tended to cross before other waiting pedestrians and that this tendency was significantly higher in observed pedestrians than in a null model: a simulation in which pedestrians did not follow each other. Also, by fitting the null model, we found that on average a person was 1.5-2.5 times more likely to cross if their neighbor had started to cross. Second, we found that males tended to follow others more than females. Third, we observed that some individuals started to cross and then returned to the roadside. These individuals were more frequently found in groups and tended to start to cross relatively later than other pedestrians. These observations suggest that some of these individuals made incorrect decisions about the timing of their crossing and that this was due to social information use. Finally, we propose that the relatively small benefit of a reduced waiting time came at the cost of an increased risk of injury, making the beneficial value of social information use questionable in this context.},

  abstract  = {Human motion models are finding an increasing number of novel applications in many different fields, such as building design, computer graphics and robot motion planning. The Social Force Model is one of the most popular alternatives to describe the motion of pedestrians. By resorting to a physical analogy, individuals are assimilated to point-wise particles subject to social forces which drive their dynamics. Such a model implicitly assumes that humans move isotropically. On the contrary, empirical evidence shows that people do have a preferred direction of motion, walking forward most of the time. Lateral motions are observed only in specific circumstances, such as when navigating in overcrowded environments or avoiding unexpected obstacles. In this paper, the Headed Social Force Model is introduced in order to improve the realism of the trajectories generated by the classical Social Force Model. The key feature of the proposed approach is the inclusion of the pedestriansheading into the dynamic model used to describe the motion of each individual. The force and torque representing the model inputs are computed as suitable functions of the force terms resulting from the traditional Social Force Model. Moreover, a new force contribution is introduced in order to model the behavior of people walking together as a single group. The proposed model features high versatility, being able to reproduce both the unicycle-like trajectories typical of people moving in open spaces and the point-wise motion patterns occurring in high density scenarios. Extensive numerical simulations show an increased regularity of the resulting trajectories and confirm a general improvement of the model realism.},

 abstract = {In this article we present an improved version of the Cellular Automata floor field model making use of a sub-mesh system to increase the maximum density allowed during simulation and reproduce phenomena observed in dense crowds. In order to calibrate the model's parameters and to validate it we used data obtained from an empirical observation of bidirectional pedestrian flow. A good agreement was found between numerical simulation and experimental data and, in particular, the double outflow peak observed during the formation of deadlocks could be reproduced in numerical simulations, thus allowing the analysis of deadlock formation and dissolution. Finally, we used the developed high density model to compute the flow-ratio dependent fundamental diagram of bidirectional flow, demonstrating the instability of balanced flow and predicting the bidirectional flow behavior at very high densities. The model we presented here can be used to prevent dense crowd accidents in the future and to investigate the dynamics of the accidents which already occurred in the past. Additionally, fields such as granular and active matter physics may benefit from the developed framework to study different collective phenomena.},

 abstract = {Random slowdown process and lock-step effect, observed from real-life observation and the experiments of other researchers, were investigated in the view of the pedestrian microscopic behaviors. Due to the limited controllability, repeatability and randomness of the pedestrian experiments, a new estimating-correction cellular automaton was established to research the influence of random slowdown process and lock-step effect on the fundamental diagram. The first step of the model is to estimate the next time-step status of the neighbor cell in front of the tracked pedestrian. The second step is to correct the status and confirm the position of the tracked pedestrian in the next time-step. It is found that the random slowdown process and lock-step have significant influence on the curve configuration and the characteristic parameters, including the concavity-convexity, the inflection point, the maximum flow rate and the critical density etc. The random slowdown process reduces the utilization of the available space between two adjacent pedestrians in the longitudinal direction, especially in the region of intermediate density. However, the lock-step effect enhances the utilization of the available space, especially in the region of high density.},

 abstract = {Pedestrian dynamics plays an important role in public facility design and evacuation management. During an escape process from a large public space, crowd behavior is a collection of pedestrian exit/route choice behavior, and movement behavior. Modelling such an escape process is an extremely complex challenge. In this paper, an integrated macro-micro approach is developed to simulate the escape process. An analysis of the simulation reveals the mechanisms of the formation of crowd congestion and flow distribution. At the macroscopic level, a mathematical model, based on the concept of the dynamic user optimal (DUO) criterion, is formulated to describe the pedestrian exit/route choice behavior. A method based on the fundamental diagram and point-queuing theory is developed to estimate the pedestrian escape time. At the microscopic level, a modified social force model is adopted to formulate pedestrians' dynamic movements during the escape process. A solution algorithm is proposed to solve the macro-micro integrated model and a series of experiments are carried out to validate the proposed model. The simulation results agree with the extracted experimental data. Finally, the integrated model and algorithm are used to simulate the escape process in a large public place. The proposed approach is able to generate the bandwagon effect, bottleneck effect, and route choice patterns.},

 abstract = {We report a thorough analysis of the intermittent flow of pedestrians through a narrow door. The observations include five different sets of evacuation drills with which we have investigated the effect of door size and competitiveness on the flow dynamics. Although the outcomes are in general compatible with the existence of the faster-is-slower effect, the temporal evolution of the instantaneous flow rate provides evidence of new features. These stress the crucial role of the number of people performing the tests, which has an influence on the obtained results. Once the transients at the beginning and end of the evacuation are removed, we have found that the time lapses between the passage of two consecutive pedestrians display heavy-tailed distributions in all the scenarios studied. Meanwhile, the distribution of burst sizes decays exponentially; this can be linked to a constant probability of finding a long-lasting clog during the evacuation process. Based on these results, a discussion is presented on the caution that should be exercised when measuring or describing the intermittent flow of pedestrians through narrow doors.},

 abstract = {Among the many fascinating examples of collective behavior exhibited by animal groups, some species are known to alternate slow group dispersion in space with rapid aggregation phenomena induced by a sudden behavioral shift at the individual level. We study this phenomenon quantitatively in large groups of grazing Merino sheep under controlled experimental conditions. Our analysis reveals strongly intermittent collective dynamics consisting of fast, avalanche-like regrouping events distributed on all experimentally accessible scales. As a proof of principle, we introduce an agent-based model with individual behavioral shifts, which we show to account faithfully for all collective properties observed. This offers, in turn, an insight on the individual stimulus/response functions that can generate such intermittent behavior. In particular, the intensity of sheep allelomimetic behavior plays a key role in the group's ability to increase the per capita grazing surface while minimizing the time needed to regroup into a tightly packed configuration. We conclude that the emergent behavior reported probably arises from the necessity to balance two conflicting imperatives: (i) the exploration of foraging space by individuals and (ii) the protection from predators offered by being part of large, cohesive groups. We discuss our results in the context of the current debate about criticality in biology.},

Agent-based models (ABMs) describe interactions among individual agents and their environment, and provide a process-oriented alternative to descriptive mathematical models. Recent \{ABMs\} provide compelling accounts of group pattern formation, contagion and cooperation, and can be used to predict, manipulate and improve upon collective behavior. \{ABMs\} overcome an assumption that underlies much of cognitive science -- that the individual is the crucial unit of cognition. The alternative advocated here is that individuals participate in collective organizations that they might not understand or even perceive, and that these organizations affect and are affected by individual behavior.},

 abstract = {Migration of organisms (or cells) is typically an adaptive response to spatiotemporal variation in resources that requires individuals to detect and respond to long-range and noisy environmental gradients. Many organisms, from wildebeest to bacteria, migrate en masse in a process that can involve a vast number of individuals. Despite the ubiquity of collective migration, and the key function it plays in the ecology of many species, it is still unclear what role social interactions play in the evolution of migratory strategies. Here, we explore the evolution of migratory behavior using an individual-based spatially explicit model that incorporates the costs and benefits of obtaining directional cues from the environment and evolvable social interactions among migrating individuals. We demonstrate that collective migratory strategies evolve under a wide range of ecological scenarios, even when social encounters are rare. Although collective migration appears to be a shared navigational process, populations typically consist of small proportions of individuals actively acquiring directional information from their environment, whereas the majorities use a socially facilitated movement behavior. Because many migratory species face severe threat through anthropogenic influences, we also explore the microevolutionary response of migratory strategies to environmental pressures. We predict a gradual decline of migration due to increasing habitat destruction and argue that much greater restoration is required to recover lost behaviors (i.e., a strong hysteresis effect). Our results provide insights into both the proximate and ultimate factors that underlie evolved migratory behavior in nature.},

  abstract  = {How humans resolve non-trivial tradeoffs in their navigational choices between the social interactions (e.g., the presence and movements of others) and the physical factors (e.g., spatial distances, route visibility) when escaping from threats in crowded confined spaces? The answer to this question has major implications for the planning of evacuations and the safety of mass gatherings as well as the design of built environments. Due to the challenges of collecting behavioral data from naturally-occurring evacuation settings, laboratory-based virtual-evacuation experiments have been practiced in a number of studies.  This class of experiments faces the traditional question of contextual bias and generalizability: How reliably can we infer humans' behavior from decisions made in hypothetical settings? Here, we address these questions by making a novel link between two different forms of empirical observations. We conduct hypothetical emergency exit-choice experiments framed as simple pictures, and then mimic those hypothetical scenarios in more realistic fashions through staging mock evacuation trials with actual crowds. Econometric choice models are estimated based on the observations made in both experimental contexts. The models are contrasted with each other from a number of perspectives including their predictions as well as the sign, magnitude, statistical significance, person-to-person variations (reflecting individuals' perception/preference differences) and the scale (reflecting context-dependent decision randomness) of their inferred parameters. Results reveal a surprising degree of resemblance between the models derived from the two contexts. Most strikingly, they produce fairly similar prediction probabilities whose differences average less than 10%. There is also unexpected consensus between the inferences derived from both experimental sources on many aspects of people's behavior notably in terms of the perception of social interactions. Results show that we could have elicited peoples' escape strategies with fair precision without observing them in action (i.e., simply by using only hypothetical-choice data as an inexpensive, practical and non-invasive experimental technique in this context). As a broader application, this offers promising evidence as to the potential applicability of the hypothetical-decision experiments to other decision contexts (at least for non-financial decisions) when field or real-world data is prohibitively unavailable. As a practical application, the behavioral insights inferred from our observations (reflected in the estimated parameters) can improve how accurately we predict the movement patterns of human crowds in emergency scenarios arisen in complex spaces. Fully-generic-in-parameters, our proposed models can even be directly introduced to a broad range of crowd simulation software to replicate navigation decision making of evacuees.},

 abstract = {Pedestrian movement models have been developed since the 1970s. A review of the literature shows that such models have been developed to explain and predict macro, meso, and micro movement patterns. However, recent developments in modelling techniques, and especially advances in agent-based simulation, open up the possibility of developing integrative and complex models which use existing models as 'building blocks'. In this paper we describe such integrative, modular approach to simulating pedestrian movement behaviour. The STREETS model, developed by using Swarm and GIS, is an agent-based model that focuses on the simulation of the behavioural aspects of pedestrian movement. The modular structure of the simulation is described in detail. This is followed by a discussion of the lessons learned from the development of STREETS, especially the advantages of adopting a modular approach and other aspects of using the agent-based paradigm for modelling.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for studying pedestrians' behavior at pedestrian crossings. To help understand the behavior of pedestrians, separate models were developed and estimated for divided and undivided streets. Estimated models include waiting time at the curbside and the number of crossing attempts needed by the pedestrian to make a successful crossing. From a broad range of road user and roadway factors, the strongest and most significant predictors which influenced the pedestrian's waiting time and the frequency of attempts to cross the streets were gender, age, number of children in household, crossing frequency, number of people in the group attempting to cross, access to private vehicle, destination, home location in relation to pedestrian crossing, and pedestrian past involvement in traffic accidents. In addition to these predictors, maximum likelihood estimates revealed that the pedestrian expected waiting time seems to profoundly influence the number of attempts needed to successfully cross the street (divided or undivided). Furthermore, results relating to pedestrian crossings on divided streets indicate that the pedestrian's expected waiting time when crossing from one side of the street to the central refuge island seem to increase the risk to end the waiting time when crossing from the refuge island to the other side of the street. Finally, results seem to suggest that pedestrians behave differently or have different waiting times as they cross from one side of the street to the refuge and from the refuge to the other side of the street.},

Although these phenomena are often very different from the ones known from equilibrium thermodynamics, their description is mostly possible by applying and extending methods from statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics. Some of the questions now understood are the following: Why are vehicles sometimes stopped by so-called "phantom traffic jams", although they all like to drive fast? What are the mechanisms behind stop-and-go traffic? Why are there several different kinds of congestion, and how are they related? Why do most traffic jams occur considerably before the road capacity is reached? Can a temporary reduction of the traffic volume cause a lasting traffic jam? Why do pedestrians moving in opposite directions normally organize in lanes, while nervous crowds are "freezing by heating"? Why do panicking pedestrians produce dangerous deadlocks? What consequences does their herding behavior have?},

If the inflow is below the maximum outflow, we find an asymptotic stationary solution. If the inflow is above this value, we observe queue formation, which can be described by a shock wave equation. We also address the experimental observation of intermittent outflows, taking into account the lack of space in the merging zone by a minimum function and coordination problems by a stochastic variable. This results in avalanches of different sizes even if friction, force networks, inelastic collapse, or delay-induced stop-and-go waves are not assumed. Our intermittent flows result from a random alternation between particle propagation and gap propagation. Erratic flows in congested merging zones of vehicle traffic may be explained in a similar way.},

 abstract = {Many observations of the dynamics of pedestrian crowds, including various self-organization phenomena, have been successfully described by simple many-particle models. For ethical reasons, however, there is a serious lack of experimental data regarding crowd panic. Therefore, we have analyzed video recordings of the crowd disaster in Mina/Makkah during the Hajj in 1426H on 12 January 2006. They reveal two subsequent, sudden transitions from laminar to stop-and-go and "turbulent" flows, which question many previous simulation models. While the transition from laminar to stop-and-go flows supports a recent model of bottleneck flows [D. Helbing et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 168001 (2006)], the subsequent transition to turbulent flow is not yet well understood. It is responsible for sudden eruptions of pressure release comparable to earthquakes, which cause sudden displacements and the falling and trampling of people. The insights of this study into the reasons for critical crowd conditions are important for the organization of safer mass events. In particular, they allow one to understand where and when crowd accidents tend to occur. They have also led to organizational changes, which have ensured a safe Hajj in 1427H.},

 abstract = {Moving animal groups display remarkable feats of coordination. This coordination is largely achieved when individuals adjust their movement in response to their neighbours{\textquoteright} movements and positions. Recent advancements in automated tracking technologies, including computer vision and GPS, now allow researchers to gather large amounts of data on the movements and positions of individuals in groups. Furthermore, analytical techniques from fields such as statistical physics now allow us to identify the precise interaction rules used by animals on the move. These interaction rules differ not only between species, but also between individuals in the same group. These differences have wide-ranging implications, affecting how groups make collective decisions and driving the evolution of collective motion. Here, I describe how trajectory data can be used to infer how animals interact in moving groups. I give examples of the similarities and differences in the spatial and directional organisations of animal groups between species, and discuss the rules that animals use to achieve this organisation. I then explore how groups of the same species can exhibit different structures, and ask whether this results from individuals adapting their interaction rules. I then examine how the interaction rules between individuals in the same groups can also differ, and discuss how this can affect ecological and evolutionary processes. Finally, I suggest areas of future research.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an extension of the standardized Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), in order to capture the input data required for performing pedestrian  simulations. Pedestrian simulations can identify potential threats already in the design phase of a building and evaluate protective measures. The BIM model serves as a central structure, which is going to be optimized by simulations (cf. figure 1). The building design is validated by a pedestrian simulation against performance indicators like the overall evacuation time or densities inside congestions. In order to improve the corresponding performance of the building, the simulator can automatically optimize relevant features of the BIM model - like door openings and wave breakers. After a review by the architect or engineer, the changes can be directly transferred to the model. Pedestrian streams turned out to be a limiting factor for building safety, particularly regarding emergency evacuation and the capacity of critical elements like stairways, escalators and elevators.},

 abstract = {To support planning, design, and management of pedestrian infrastructure, dynamic assignment models are useful tools. However, current models are network-based and presume that travelers can choose between a finite number of discrete route alternatives. For walking facilities, where pedestrians can choose their paths freely in two-dimensional space, applicability of these traditional network models is limited. This article puts forward an approach for user-optimal dynamic assignment in continuous time and space. Contrary to network-based approaches, the theory allows the traffic units to choose from an infinite non-countable set of paths through the considered space. The approach consists of three interrelated steps, that is: determining the continuous paths using a path choice model, assigning the origin-destination flows, and calculating the resulting traffic conditions. The approach to determine a user-optimal assignment is heuristic and consists of a sequence of all-or-nothing assignments in continuous time-space. The article presents the mathematical problem formulation, solution approaches, and application examples.},

 abstract = {In most existing pedestrian dynamic models, agents are modeled as sliding or jumping objects. As a kind of bipedal creature, however, this assumption makes it difficult to include some important human walking characteristics in the models, such as the periodicity of stepping, the adjustment of step frequency and step length, and the change of personal space within the same step cycle. To take these characteristics into consideration, a biped model is developed to simulate pedestrian locomotion by physical step rather than by time step. The model consists of two components: the stepping simulator and the adjustment of velocity for each step. Simulation results show that the velocity-density relations are consistent with the empirical data. Stable stop-and -go waves are simulated with a critical density. Furthermore, with the considering of biped movement, the lock-step phenomenon is reproduced. The model provides new possibilities to study crowd behavior while considering personal bipedal mechanics.},

 abstract = {The equations of motion governing the two-dimensional flow of pedestrians are derived for flows of both single and multiple pedestrian types. Two regimes of flow, a high-density (subcritical) and a low-density (supercritical) flow regimes, are possible, rather than two flow regimes for each type of pedestrian. A subcritical flow always fills the space available. However, a supercritical flow may either fill the space available or be self-confining for each type of pedestrian, depending on the boundary location. Although, the equations governing these flows are simultaneous, time-dependent, non-linear, partial differential equations, remarkably they may be made conformally mappable. The solution of these equations becomes trivial in many situations. Free streamline calculations, utilizing this property, reveal both upstream and downstream separation of the flow of pedestrians around an obstacle. Such analysis tells much about the nature of the assumptions used in various models for the flow of pedestrians. The present theory is designed for the development of general techniques to understand the motion of large crowds. However, it is also useful as a predictive tool. The behavior predicted by these equations of motion is compared with aerial observations for the Jamarat Bridge near Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is shown that, for this important case, pedestrian, that is pilgrims, aim at achieving each immediate goal in minimum time rather than achieving all goals in overall minimum time. Typical of many examples, this case illustrated the strong dependence of path on the psychological state of the pedestrians involved. It is proposed that the flow of pedestrians over the Jamarat Bridge be improved by appropriate barrier placement, that force an effective global view of the goals.},

A well designed behavior-based prototype system is developed, which takes the advantages of the dynamics of interaction among the basis behaviors repertoires. The basis behaviors repertoires implemented by decision rules are composed of three parts, which correspond to the behaviors of the civilians, riots and soldiers  respectively. Then these basis behaviors are combined into more complex behaviors by behavior selection mechanism. Eventually realistic crowd phenomena are created in the scenarios of riot controlling in city environment. We argue that this approach gives better results than conventional methods.},

 abstract = {Microscopic simulation of pedestrian traffic is an important and increasingly popular method to evaluate the performance of existing or proposed infrastructure. The social force model is a common model in simulations, describing the dynamics of pedestrian crowds given the goals of the simulated pedestrians encoded as their preferred velocities. The main focus of the literature has so far been how to choose the preferred velocities to produce realistic dynamic route choices for pedestrians moving through congested infrastructure. However, limited attention has been given the problem of choosing the preferred velocity to produce other behaviors, such as waiting, commonly occurring at, e.g., public transport interchange stations. We hypothesize that: (1) the inclusion of waiting pedestrians in a simulated scenario will significantly affect the level of service for passing pedestrians, and (2) the details of the waiting model affect the predicted level of service, that is, it is important to choose an appropriate model of waiting. We show that the treatment of waiting pedestrians have a significant impact on simulations of pedestrian traffic. We do this by introducing a series of extensions to the social force model to produce waiting behavior, and provide predictions of the model extensions that highlight their differences. We also present a sensitivity analysis and provide sufficient criteria for stability.},

We examined for the first time large-scale movement patterns of a solitary-ranging and small-brained mammal, the mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), by using the change-point test and a heuristic random travel model to get insight into foraging strategies and potential route-planning abilities. Mouse lemurs are small nocturnal primates inhabiting the seasonal dry deciduous forest in Madagascar. During the lean season with limited food availability, these lemurs rely on few stationary food resources. We radio-tracked seven lemurs and analysed their foraging patterns. First change-points coincided with out-of-sight keystone food resources. Travel paths were more efficient in detecting these resources than a heuristic random travel model within limits of estimated detection distance. Findings suggest that even nocturnal, solitary-ranging mammals with small brains plan their route to an out-of-sight target. Thus, similar ecological pressures may lead to comparable spatial cognitive skills irrespective of the degree of sociality or relative brain size.},

All modes of transport have to be granted their very own right of way. Stakeholders of particular modes, tourists and commuters, old and young have their own needs and ideas and they all demand to be involved in the planning process of transport projects without having to dig into the words and numbers produced by traffic engineers. Microsimulation is a tool which accommodates both: the requirements that are set by the complexity of such projects, as well as the needs to produce easy-to-understand information and communication material. This paper demonstrates the capability of microsimulation through a French case study, including the planning and design of transport schemes for a busy city centre and urban area where all modes of transport are being used and there is a strong focus of public attention.},

 abstract = {Three experimental studies of interdependent escape, based on a laboratory simulation of one type of panic situation, have been reported. Each collection of subjects was given a limited amount of time to escape from an imminent danger, but they were able to escape only one at a time. The major findings from the experiments are: 1. (1) As threatened penalty for failure to escape increases, the percentage of persons who succeed in doing so declines. 2. (2) As size of the collection increases, the percentage escaping declines. This may also be stated as an increase in the time required per escape with increasing size. There remains considerable ambiguity about the shape of this function. 3. (3) If members of the collection are oriented toward taking their behavioral cues from each other, as compared with an orientation toward making their behavioral decisions independently of one another, the effect upon escape may be either a deleterious one (When at the outset there is generally little optimism about escape) or a salutary one (when the general level of initial optimism is high.) 4. (4) The availability of a distinctive response for the public expression of confidence greatly increases the percentage of persons who succeed in escaping. The results are taken as indicating the fruitfulness of analyzing the interdependent escape situation in terms of present-day concepts and principles of social influence.},

Finally, with comparative analysis of experiment data, the developed simulation model was able to replicate the situation in which pedestrians find an available booth to occupy while waiting in a queue. The model can facilitate the availability of various pedestrian flows and a range of operating times. With some efforts of computer programming, the situations where multiple booths are available were simulated to identify pedestrian movement. The developed simulation model captures important details, such as travel time, wait time, queue length and the number of waiting pedestrians with the different number of pedestrian flows and booths. The paper presents a means to designing the pedestrian operation and plan on the basis of the estimated number of people.},

Two major difficulties are intrinsical to the problem: two-dimensional movement of pedestrians and the complexity of psychological and social influences. In this paper a simple CA-model for the description of crowd motion is presented and its implementation in a simulation software outlined. The validity of the assumptions and the scope of the applications will have to be scrutinised by comparison with empirical data from actual evacuations or drills.},

 abstract = {This thesis introduces new methods for modelling human wayfinding behavior in the context of microscopic pedestrian simulation models. The basis forms a navigation graph, which is automatically derived from the underlying geometry of a scenario. Applying a cone-based search method, the resulting graph is on the one hand as sparse as possible and on the other hand detailed enough to be able to serve as a wayfinding basis. It is used to combine the microscopic simulation model with a macroscopic dy- namic network model in terms of a control cycle. As a result, the gap between the evacuation times computed by both models is reduced: The coupled model considers both optimized routing strategies and microscopic effects. To model human wayfinding behavior, cognitive processes are considered. The- se processes are translated into wayfinding algorithms, which are based on the derived navigation graph. Different levels of familiarity of a place as well as the distinction between everyday life and evacuation situations are considered by de- fining different metrics on the graph. These algorithms are validated by an experiment performed at Technische Uni- versit\"{a}t M\"{u}nchen. To compare real-world data to the results of the algorithms, a new metric "similarity" is introduced. This metric allows meaningful compari- sons between simulation data and experimental data. The results showed a good match between the real world data and the algorithms. This leads to the con- clusion that human wayfinding does not only rely on one specific criteria, but is influenced by different factors. The usage of sparse navigation graphs enables a combination between macrosco- pic network flow models and microscopic models to derive more realistic evacua- tion times. The incorporation of cognitive processes led to the realistic modelling of human wayfinding behavior.},

 abstract = {An increasing global population forces urban planners to construct buildings and infrastructure that is extremely deep and high. Elevators and escalators serve skyscrapers and tunnels, but in an emergency people still have to walk on stairs. Computer simulations can mitigate risks of escape situations. For these situations,pedestrian locomotion models need to match reality well. Motion on stairs, however, is not nearly as well understood as motion in the plane. Publications are scarce and some arecontradictory. As a result, movement on stairs is usually modeled by slowing down pedestrians by a fixed factor. But is this justified? And what happens at intermediate landings? This contribution aims to clarify inconclusive results of previous research and provide new information to directly incorporate empirical results into a parsimoniouscomputer model. The algorithms are freely available through an open-source framework. After outlining the shortcomings of existing approaches, we present three experiments, from which we derive requirements for the computer model. Reenacting computer experiments shows the extent to which our model meets our observations. We conclude with an applied example, simulating an evacuation of Germany's famous Neuschwanstein Castle.},

 abstract = {Recent research has confirmed that social behavior, especially helpfulness, is affected by the environmental input level: As the level of environmental bombardment increases, the level of helpfulness decreases. This study was designed to evaluate one explanation for this effect, the restricted awareness explanation. We hypothesized that as environmental bombardment increases, people become less aware of peripheral objects and happenings in their immediate surroundings. This characteristic may be part of a general adjustment to high-input levels, which may also include an increase in walking speed and a decrease in visual scanning of the environment. The results confirmed each of these expectations. During periods of high traffic noise and density, in contrast to low periods, pedestrians were found to be less aware of novel objects placed along their route, to walk faster, and to engage more in a straight-ahead gaze fixation.},

in simulation studies. Simulation models depend on a number of parameters
whose exact values are often unknown. Prominent examples are the
number of pedestrians or their free-ow speeds. We carry out sensitivity
studies to analyze the system behaviour when crucial model parameters
are varied. We compute Sobol' indices using polynomial chaos expansion
to identify parameters with a strong impact on important evacuation
quantities such as the density in front of the bottleneck. A further di-
culty in this process arises from the fact that many simulation models,
including the one we use, are not strictly deterministic. In this paper,
we propose a pragmatic approach to deal with this stochasticity of the

  abstract     = {To assess a computer model's descriptive and predictive power, the model's response to uncertainties in the input must be quantified. However, simulations of complex systems typically need a lot of computational resources, and thus prohibit exhaustive sweeps of high-dimensional spaces. Moreover, the time available to compute a result for decision systems is often very limited. In this paper, we construct a data-driven surrogate model from time delays of observations of a complex, microscopic model. We employ diffusion maps to reduce the dimensionality of the delay space. The surrogate model allows faster generation of the quantity of interest over time than the original, microscopic model. It is a non-intrusive method, and hence does not need access to the model formulation. In contrast to most other surrogate approaches, the construction allows quantities of interest that are not closed dynamically, because a closed state space is constructed through Takens delay embedding. Also, the surrogate can be stored to and loaded from storage with very little effort. The surrogate model is decoupled from the original model, and the fast execution speed allows to quickly evaluate many different parameter distributions. We demonstrate the capability of the approach in combination with forward UQ on a parametrized Burgers? equation, and the microscopic simulation of a train station. The surrogate model can accurately capture the dynamical features in both examples, with relative errors always smaller than ten percent. The simulation time in the real-world example can be reduced by an order of magnitude.},

their treatment of psychological crowds as mere aggregations of individuals.
Indeed most models for evacuation dynamics use analogies from physics where
pedestrians are considered as particles. Although this ensures that the results
of the simulation match important physical phenomena, such as the deceleration
of the crowd with increasing density, social phenomena such as group processes
are ignored. In particular, people in a crowd have social identities and share
those social identities with the others in the crowd. The process of self
categorisation determines norms within the crowd and influences how people will
behave in evacuation situations. We formulate the application of social
identity in pedestrian simulation algorithmically. The goal is to examine
whether it is possible to carry over the psychological model to computer models
of pedestrian motion so that simulation results correspond to observations from
crowd psychology. That is, we quantify and formalise empirical research on and
verbal descriptions of the effect of group identity on behaviour. We use
uncertainty quantification to analyse the model's behaviour when we vary
crucial model parameters. In this first approach we restrict ourselves to a
specific scenario that was thoroughly investigated by crowd psychologists and
where some quantitative data is available: the bombing and subsequent
evacuation of a London underground tube carriage on July 7th 2005.},

be considered a special group within a crowd because of its unique behaviour. While families may become

according to ndings in psychology, family members search for each other and evacuate once they are reunited.
However, it is not exceptional that families are separated at the beginning of an emergency. According to
psychological ndings, family members search for each other and evacuate after they are reunited. The model
presented in this paper transfers these ndings into pedestrian evacuation simulation. We describe how we
model the behaviour of separated families and qualitatively validate the model. With the help of uncertainty
quantication and Sobol indices, we analyse the impact of three uncertain parameters of the model on the
evacuation times: the percentage of family members in the crowd, the speed at which parents search for their
children, and the speed of the children evacuating with their parents. As a result, we can show that it is vital
to consider families in evacuation simulation to better estimate of the evacuation times.},

However, a high density does not always mean an increase in activity, as certain people are simply passing the area at a given time. The primary goal of this study was to introduce a set of indicators for measuring the bustle of the
area, which we call "Nigiwai", from pedestrian movement by using an analogy from classical kinematics. Such indicators can be used to measure the impact of promotional events and to optimize the design of the area. Our novel indicators were evaluated with simulated pedestrian scenarios and were demonstrated to distinguish shopping scenarios from those in which people move around without shopping successfully,
even when the latter scenarios had much higher densities. The indicators were computed solely from the pedestrian trajectory, which can easily be obtained from ordinary sensors using deep learning-based techniques. As a demonstration with real data, we applied our method to a video of a street and provided a visualization of the indicators.},

  abstract = {Crowd egress at narrow exit is a popular research topic, due to its intrinsic importance in architectural designs and building codes. However, relatively few studies have been conducted to verify the performance of pedestrian models for crowd escape at exits, especially relating to different exit designs. This paper aims to verify the applicability of a microscopic pedestrian simulation model, Social Force Model (SFM), embedded in Viswalk software to reproduce the effect of exit design on egress flow under normal and emergency conditions. Empirical data from controlled experiments considering the effects of obstacles size and location of exits under normal and emergency conditions were tested and compared with the simulation from the SFM. Results indicated that after parameter optimization, Viswalk simulation model can provide reasonable estimates for crowd escape under normal situations with a mean RMSE value 1.97s for total evacuation time. However, the simulation model was less capable in reproducing the emergency condition. As compared to the empirical data, clogging events were less spotted under emergency in the simulation. Faster-is-slower effects were not found in both empirical and simulation scenarios. In addition, the exit location effects from simulation data agreed with empirical data, corner exits were more efficient than middle exits under both situations. Meanwhile, the obstacle effects, as observed in empirical data, were less reproduced in the simulation, especially under emergency conditions. The results suggest that the application of the Viswalk model in simulating emergency situations needs scrutiny and further investigations in the future with empirical data.},

Notably, we observe that the density should not be higher than 0.16 pedestrians per square meter (around 6 m2 per pedestrian) in order to guarantee an interpersonal distance of 1 m. Although the extrapolation of our findings to other more realistic scenarios is not straightforward, they can be used as a first approach to establish density restrictions in urban and architectonic spaces based on scientific evidence.},

Recent models have utilised agent-based models and complex networks to explicitly study heterogeneous interaction patterns, but this leads to an increasing computational complexity. Compartmental models are appealing because of their simplicity, but their parameters, especially the transmission rate, are complex and depend on a number of factors, which makes it hard to predict how a change of a single environmental, demographic, or epidemiological factor will affect the population. Therefore, in this contribution we propose a middle ground, utilising crowd-behaviour research to improve compartmental models in crowded situations. We show how both the rate of infection as well as the walking speed depend on the local crowd density around an infected individual. The combined effect is that the rate of infection at a population scale has an analytically tractable non-linear dependency on crowd density. We model the spread of a hypothetical disease in a corridor and compare our new model with a typical compartmental model, which highlights the regime in which current models may not produce credible results.},

Many control measures devoted to decrease contact among people have been adopted to slow down the transmission of the disease. A series of measures have been taken in supermarkets, which include restricting the number of customers, keeping social distance, and entering with a shopping cart. In this work, we investigate with numerical simulations the effectiveness of these measures in reducing the contact among customers. Several scenarios with different control measures are designed for numerical analysis. The movements of customers in a supermarket are simulated by a microscopic model for pedestrian dynamics. Moreover, an index based on the distance between customers is defined to measure the degree of contact and therefore evaluate it quantitatively. The effect of these measures on the average contact degree of each customer is explored, and the spatial distribution of the contact among customers in the supermarket is shown in a qualitative way. Simulation results show that except shopping cart measure, the other two measures are effective in reducing contact among customers.},

abstract = {The fires in underground indoor space often result in limited field of vision, thus revealing the characteristic of exit-selecting behavior under the influence of fire and limited view is the basis for optimizing exit layout and emergency evacuation strategies for the underground spaces. In this study, an interactive virtual environment is presented and using which an evacuation experiment is carried out to test human exit-selecting behavior in fire scenario. The results show that when the view is limited, more exits and arranging the exits evenly are helpful to shorten the time of seeking the available exits. If there is congestion in front, as long as the information on the exits is sufficient, some people (more than 20\%) will re-select the other exits. Furthermore, people prefer to spend more movement time reducing queuing time. When the dynamic temperature field is used to show the participants a spreading fire, the virtual fire plays a certain threat, so most of subjects (96.7\%) prefer the exit away from the fire source. Moreover, if there are other pedestrians, the evacuation decision-making process of personnel is the game process among selecting the fastest path, keeping away from the exits near the fire source and avoiding high temperature field. The results also show that individual age has an obvious correlation with the participants??? ability of escaping in the virtual evacuation environment. Specifically, the ability tends to become weaker as the age increased. This study will be useful to understand the human exit-selecting behavior and movement characteristics in the influence of fire and limited view by using a cheap and safe method.},

In the present paper, we report three studies that investigated the effects of map complexity and crowd movement on wayfinding time, accuracy and hesitation using both online and laboratory-based networked virtual reality (VR) platforms. In the online study, we found that simple map designs led to shorter decision times and higher accuracy compared to complex map designs. In the networked VR set-up, we found that co-present participants made very few errors. In the final VR study, we replayed the traces of participants' avatars from the second study so that they indicated a different direction than the maps. In this scenario, we found an interaction between map design and crowd movement in terms of decision time and the distributions of locations at which participants hesitated. Together, these findings can help the designers of maps for public spaces account for the movements of real crowds.},

Unfortunately, existing researches fail to effectively describe children evacuation, which is likely due to the lack of experimental and empirical data. In this paper, a questionnaire-based experiment was conducted with children aged 8???12 years to study children route choice behavior during evacuation from in a classroom with two exits. 173 effective questionnaires were collected and the corresponding data were analyzed. From the statistical results, we obtained the following findings: (1) position, congestion, group behavior, and backtracking behavior have significant effects on children route choice during evacuation; (2) age only affects children backtracking behavior, and (3) no prominent effects based on gender and guidance were observed. The above findings may help engineers design some effective evacuation strategies for children.},

  abstract     = {Protest demonstrations are a manifestation of fundamental rights. Authorities are responsible for guiding protesters safely along predefined routes, typically set in an urban built environment. Microscopic crowd simulations support decision-makers in finding sustainable crowd management strategies. 
Planning routes usually requires knowledge about the length of the demonstration march. This case study quantifies the impact of two uncertain parameters, the number of protesters and the standard deviation of their free-flow speeds, on the length of a protest march through Kaiserslautern, Germany. Over 1000 participants walking through more than 100000 m2 lead to a computationally demanding model that cannot be analyzed with a standard Monte Carlo ansatz. We select and apply analysis methods that are efficient for large topographies. This combination constitutes the main novelty of this paper: We compute Sobol indices with two different methods, based on polynomial chaos expansions, for a down-scaled version of the original set-up and compare them to Monte Carlo computations. We employ the more accurate of the approaches for the full-scale scenario. The global sensitivity analysis reveals a shift in the governing parameter from the number of protesters to the standard deviation of their free-flow speeds over time, stressing the benefits of a time-dependent analysis. We discuss typical actions, for example floats that reduce the variation of the free-flow speed, and their effectiveness in view of the findings.},

  pages     = {20},
  abstract  = {The Covid-19 pandemic has changed our lives and keeps science occupied. Numerous studies contribute to understanding the pandemic, e.g. airborne and droplets were identified as main modes of transmission. This is a crucial information towards regaining control by slowing the spread. However, the individual likelihood of getting infected in everyday situations is often unknown since it depends on many influencing factors. Mathematical models can help estimate such risks, but the established epidemiological models cannot simulate the transmission at a local scale because they are macroscopic. An individual's movement directly affects its exposure to viruses bound to aerosol particles or droplets, which is why we need a microscopic approach. This study addresses the question how we can model airborne and droplet transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in everyday situations. For this purpose, we combine microscopic crowd simulations with a new model for disease transmission. Inspired by compartmental models, we describe the agents' health status as susceptible, exposed, infectious, or recovered. Infectious agents exhale pathogen, whereas susceptible agents absorb the pathogen present at their current position. This model was verified using unit tests, and it was validated against macroscopic mathematical models that are designed to calculate the risk of getting infected under specific conditions. Simulations of typical indoor situations, e.g. pedestrians walking along a passageway and pedestrians waiting in a line or crowd, indicated that the new transmission model is suited for comparing the risk of exposure in different scenarios. Besides, the simulation helps evaluate the individual exposure to pathogen, and thus, it provides qualitative information about the likelihood of getting infected. In this manner, critical or non-critical situations can be identified. The model can emerge as helpful tool for scientists from different disciplines or even decision-makers when dealing with the spread of Covid-19 and similar diseases.},

  type     = {Dissertation},
  abstract = {The understanding and prevention of catastrophes at large-scale events are of utmost societal
importance. For that, pedestrian simulation has proven to be a potent tool. Using microscopic
pedestrian simulations, researchers and practitioners investigate the mechanisms and precondi-
tions that lead to dangerous situations such as harmful crowd pressures. Simulations reveal the
behaviors and characteristics of human crowds and suggest practical ways to prevent catastro-
phes.
However, microscopic pedestrian simulations are computationally expensive. Yet, it is neces-
sary to model each individual to predict crucial phenomena. Despite their computational cost,
real-time simulations are required to make reliable predictions during ongoing events and to
enhance a research eld that integrates more and more data-driven methods. To achieve this
temporal requirement, we have to introduce and exploit ecient and parallel algorithms.
In this thesis, I follow the call for ecient and scalable simulations by analyzing existing and
introducing new parallel algorithms. I introduce parallelism to a class of microscopic models, i.e.,
optimal steps models, and show that real-time simulations of half a million participants are possi-
ble. In addition, I develop ecient and parallel algorithms to construct navigation elds: a robust
technique to model pedestrian waynding. A new meshing algorithm reduces the problem size
and a novel numerical method exploits similarities of consecutively solved eikonal equations. In
combination, real-time dynamic navigation eld computation becomes possible for many large-
scale scenarios.},

  abstract = {This dissertation contributes to the field of pedestrian dynamics. Pedestrian dynam-
ics tries to better understand crowd behavior to make gatherings safer. In particular,
one wants to avoid crowd disasters like the one at the Love Parade festival in Germany,
2010, with 21 dead or at the Hajj with hundreds of casualties in several years. Pedestrian
dynamics researchers carry out experiments and simulate large crowds and pedestrian
streams. Current crowd simulation models mostly focus on physically correct simula-
tions but neglect psychological aspects which affect crowd behavior. This dissertation
describes my efforts to model behavioral changes in agent-based simulations and how
I try to bridge the gap between computer science and social sciences to get accurate
crowd simulation results.
In Part I of this work, I conduct an exhaustive literature research on current modeling
approaches and psychological aspects. I distill three important concepts from the broad
research field of psychology that must be integrated into state-of-the-art simulations:
perception, cognition and behavior. In Part II of this dissertation, I implement these
aspects in an established open-source simulation tool. I base my modeling efforts on
latest psychological findings. I implement the findings as reusable psychology layer
which can easily be integrated into other crowd simulation tools to be beneficial for
the whole research community. My modeling effort is supported by an own experiment
with 58 participants in which I document human behavior in a specific safety-relevant
scenario. In the experiment, I extract quantitative and qualitative data for the model
refinement and validation. I use three real-world scenarios to show that my approach is
able to reenact a wide range of human behavior which can be observed in reality.
My modeling approach is easy to understand and reusable. It aims to better con-
nect natural and life sciences because knowledge from both disciplines is necessary to
simulate and understand crowd behavior. My approach also provides clear guidelines to
operationalize observed human behavior for future simulations with the three sequential
phases perception, cognition and a selection of suitable behaviors.},

These projects pose a challenge to researchers to identify suitable technical methods to develop infrastructure layouts that efficiently cater for movement of walking passengers. This paper presents an application in relation to the JR Takatsuki station where there was a narrow island platform catering for large volume of boarding, alighting and transferring passengers. In 2015, the operator has begun expanding the station to alleviate the platform congestion. The objective of the project is to develop a method of forecasting pedestrian flow patterns within a railway station for a proposed new layout of platforms and interconnecting links. The methodology will be demonstrated using Takatsuki station as a case study. The core of the methodology utilizes pedestrian origin-destination pattern to estimate measures of walking effort of pedestrians. In addition to the analytical modelling technique an application of a simulation model is also described. The simulation method is helpful as it is able to provide a visual appreciation of the future operation of the railway concourses. Results indicate that the congestion on the current platform will be alleviated. However, connecting passages to the new platform can become congested because of flow conflicts among transferring passengers and those boarding and alighting.},

This paper presents the first step of the model development: details of a unidirectional micro-simulation pedestrian model along with its calibration and validation. The model was validated by comparing simulated trajectories with real trajectories extracted from video footage by means of computer vision techniques. Results show that the average location difference between simulated and actual trajectories was 20 cm in the X direction and 40 cm in the Y direction. Results also show that the model is capable of predicting pedestrian speed with relative error of 12.8\%.},

With this approach, we isolate the most important aspects of pedestrian behaviour from a number of candidate models. We fit our models to experimental data and find that pedestrian interactions immediately in front of the bottleneck appear to be less important for the observed time lapses than interactions further away from the bottleneck. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to rigorously compare microscopic pedestrian behaviours across different contexts by fitting the same statistical models to three separate datasets. We suggest that our approach is a promising tool to establish similarities and differences between simulated and real pedestrian behaviour.},

  abstract = {Crowd simulation is a crucial tool to assess risks and engineer crowd safety at events and in built infrastructure. Simulations can be used for what-if studies, for real-time predictions, as well as to develop regulations for crowd safety. A reliable prediction requires a carefully calibrated model. Model parameters are often calibrated as point estimates, single parameter values for which the model evaluation fits given data best. In contrast, Bayesian inference provides a full posterior distribution for the fitted parameters that includes the residual uncertainty after calibration. In this work, we calibrate a microscopic model and an emulator derived from a microscopic model for crowd dynamics using point estimates and Approximate Bayesian Computation. We calibrate on data measuring the flow through a key scenario of crowd safety: a bottleneck. We vary the bottleneck width and demonstrate via three case studies the advantages and shortcomings of the two calibration techniques. In a case with a unimodal posterior, both methods yield similar results. However, one safety-relevant case study, that mimics the dynamics of evacuating people squeezing through an opening, exhibits a faster-is-slower dynamic where multiple free-flow speeds lead to the same flow. In this case, only Bayesian inference reveals the true bimodal shape of the posterior distribution. For multidimensional calibration, we illustrate that Bayesian inference allows accurate calibration by describing parameter relations. We conclude that, in practice, point estimation often seems sufficient, but Bayesian inference methods are necessary to capture important structural information about the uncertain parameters, and thus the physics of safety.},

The detection of these points and the characterization of the flows connecting them represent a typical preliminary step in most pedestrian studies and it can be supported by computer vision approaches. In this paper we propose an algorithm in which a scene is overlaid by a grid of particles initializing a dynamical system defined by optical flow, a high level global motion information. Time integration of the dynamical system produces short particle trajectories (tracklets), representing dense but short motion patterns in segments of the scene; tracklets are then extended into longer tracks that are grouped using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, where the similarity is measured by the Longest Common Subsequence. The analysis of these clusters supports the identification of sources and sinks related to a single video segment. Local segment information is finally combined to achieve a global set of traces identifying sources and sinks, and characterizing the flow of pedestrians connecting them. The paper presents the defined technique and it discusses its application in a real-world scenario.},

The framework integrates a genetic algorithm (GA) and a microscopic pedestrian simulation-Assignment model. The GA searches for the optimal evacuation plan, while the simulation model guides the search through evaluating the quality of the generated evacuation plans. Evacuees are assumed to receive evacuation instructions in terms of the optimal exit gates and evacuation start times. The framework is applied to develop an optimal evacuation plan for a hypothetical crowded exhibition hall. The obtained results show that the model converges to a superior optimal evacuation plan within an acceptable number of iterations. In addition, the obtained evacuation plan outperforms conventional plans that implement nearest-gate immediate evacuation strategies.},

This makes calibration difficult. The aim of this paper is to give practitioners an indication of how to proceed in the calibration process. For this purpose, by analytical transformations the parameters of the social force model are related to real properties that have a clear and immediate meaning and are also highly relevant result properties of a simulation: extent and clearance time of a queue, respectively maximum density, and capacity flow.

abstract = {The aging of population is a social phenomenon in the world. In this study, series of controlled experiments were performed to investigate the movement characteristics of elderly pedestrians passing through bottlenecks. Similar self-organizing phenomena to that of the younger population such as ???zipper effect??? and ???lane formation??? are observed. The highest local density that appears in front of the exit in the experiment is beyond 4 m???2. The time lapse between two consecutive pedestrians of the elderly is about 0.2???s longer than that of the young when the width is 0.5 m and 0.7 m. Besides, the difference decreases with the increasing exit width. A linear relation between flow and bottleneck width is obtained, while the flow of elders is lower, under the same width of exit, than that of the young. The waiting time of pedestrians can be divided into two stages when the bottleneck width is narrower than 0.8 m. The findings in this study will benefit the evacuation guidance as well as facility design for elders.},

abstract = {Evacuation experiments of pedestrians passing through a corridor, which acts as a bottleneck, are conducted in this study. A video processing method is used to extract the trajectories of pedestrians in the measurement section. The velocity, density, flow rate and time headway between successive pedestrians entering the bottleneck are calculated, and the relations between them are obtained from the trajectories. We report that the mean velocities for each experiment vary greatly, depending on the lanes contained in the measurement section. The mean velocity of each pedestrian in the corridor displays a trend that decreases sharply at the beginning and then fluctuates slightly around the mean value. A fundamental diagram relating density and speed is obtained. We also investigate the relation between the mean velocities of pedestrians and the density, as a function of time, and report that the mean velocity decreased while the density increased. These results are consistent with those of other researchers. The flow rate increases linearly with the bottleneck width, which is consistent with other results. The time headways are investigated in this study. It is observed that the behavior of pedestrians in the corridor, such as when they formed lanes, has a significant effect on the time headways and their distribution. The distribution of time headways in different lanes is also studied, and some interesting results are obtained. The data and results provided in this paper may be useful for improving evacuation models and designing public facilities.},

Study of collective behavior of mice can improve our understanding about the dynamics of pedestrian movement. However, its rules still need to be confirmed with adequate explanation. In this paper, collective behavior of mice passing through an exit under panic was investigated. The results showed that the total evacuation time decreased with exit width increasing in a certain range. Based on the different tendency of the curve in temporal evolution, the process of mice flow was divided into three stages. The density of mice near the exit peaks at a certain horizontal offset and starts to decrease over time. With the increase of the exit width, the duration of the higher density state decreased. We found that the frequency of time intervals obeyed a lognormal distribution or an exponential decay for different exit widths. In addition, the relationship between the group size and the group flow rate in different scenarios was analyzed. The phenomena found in our experiments show the collective behavioral characteristic of mice under panic. Our analysis in this paper will deepen our understanding of crowd dynamics in emergency condition.},

  abstract = {Describing and forecasting city traffic is challenging, given the array of factors influencing the movement of pedestrians and vehicles. Faced with this complexity, research has focused on machine learning as a way to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns, based on past sensor data. While the methods can accurately forecast high-dimensional observations, it is often hard to explain the models and their predictions. In many cases, only the predictive performance of an otherwise black box model is evaluated. An accurate but explainable alternative is provided by the Koopman operator, an emerging methodology for data-driven identification of high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamical systems. In this study, we showcase the method by analyzing pedestrian traffic data from Melbourne, Australia. We formulate our computations in the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition framework, where we approximate the Koopman operator in a function basis computed with time delay embedding and the Diffusion Map algorithm. The model captures the distinct temporal patterns of 11 traffic sensors simultaneously. Because the dynamics become linear in the operator-theoretic perspective, we can decompose the model into its spectral components. Importantly, these components facilitate interpretation and can increase scientific understanding of the underlying system and the model{\textquoteright}s operations. For the Melbourne data, we show that the spectral components connect to the underlying state space geometry and indicate the model{\textquoteright}s stability over a prediction horizon. Our study showcases how the Koopman operator framework offers explainable and accurate data-driven predictions in a real-world traffic system. The results can easily be transferred to other traffic systems.},

  abstract     = {Knowing the origins and destinations of pedestrians' paths is key to the initialization of crowd simulations. Unfortunately, they are difficult to measure in the real world. This is one major challenge for live predictions during events such as festivals, soccer games, protest marches, and many others. Sensor data can be used to feed real-world observations into simulations in real-time. As input data for this study, we use density heatmaps generated from real-world trajectory data obtained from stereo sensors. Density information is compact, of constant size, and in general easier to obtain than e.g., individual trajectories. Therefore, the information limitation improves the applicability to other scenarios. We include the absolute pedestrian trip counts from origins to destinations during a brief time interval in an OD matrix, including unknown destinations due to sensor errors. Our goal is to estimate these OD matrices from a series of density heatmaps for the same interval. For this, we compute the ground truth OD matrices and density heatmaps using real-world trajectory data from a train station. We employ linear regression as a statistical learning method for estimation. We observe that the linear share of the relationship between density and OD matrix is estimated successfully. Nevertheless, a portion of the data remains that cannot be explained. We attempt to overcome this difficulty with random forest as a nonlinear model. The results indicate that both a linear and a nonlinear model can estimate some features of the OD matrices. However, there is no clear winner in terms of the chosen metric, the $R2^$ score. Overall, our findings are a strong indicator that OD matrices can indeed be estimated from density heatmaps extracted automatically from sensors.},

The preferable positions of these neighbors during movement are investigated under various conditions. The spatial relation is quantified by calculating the distance and angle between the reference pedestrian and neighbors. The results indicate that the distribution of neighbors is closely related to the neighbor's order, crowd density, neighbor type and flow type. Furthermore, the reasons that result in these distributions for different neighbors are explored. Finally neighbor distributions for different flows are compared and the implications of this research are discussed. The spatial analysis sheds new light on the study of pedestrian dynamics in a different perspective, which can help to develop and validate crowd models in the future.},

abstract={Simulating virtual crowds is an important challenge in many areas such as games and virtual reality applications. A lot of effort has been dedicated to improving pathfinding, collision avoidance, or decision making, to achieve more realistic human-like behavior. However, crowd simulation will be far from appearing realistic as long as virtual humans are limited to walking animations. Including animation variety could greatly enhance the plausibility of the populated environment. In this paper, we evaluated to what extend animation variety can affect the perceived level of realism of a crowd, regardless of the appearance of the virtual agents (bots vs. humanoids). The goal of this study is to provide recommendations for crowd animation and rendering when simulating crowds. Our results show that the perceived realism of the crowd trajectories and animations is significantly higher when using a variety of animations as opposed to simply having locomotion animations, but only if we render realistic humanoids. If we can only render agents as bots, then there is no much gain from having animation variety, in fact, it could potentially lower the perceived quality of the trajectories.},

  abstract  = {Pedestrian crowds are not homogeneous. One common distinguishing characteristic is the membership in social groups based on friendship or families, for example. It is important to understand how these social groups affect pedestrian dynamics to inform their consideration in safety planning. Despite previous work on social groups, there is a paucity of controlled experiments on their effect under normal conditions which is crucial to delineate relative risks to pedestrians in non-emergency situations. To address this, we present results from controlled experiments on the influence of dyadic social groups in unidirectional pedestrian flow. We consider crowds comprised of 100\%, 67\%, or 0\% social groups. Our experimental setting results in crowd densities between 1.25 and 4.0 pedestrians per m2. We find that while the relationship between pedestrian speed and density is affected by the presence of social groups, the size of this effect is smaller than the overall variability of observations. In contrast, we find clear differences in movement dynamics between individuals and social groups. Social groups move at slower speeds and overtake others less frequently. Regardless of pedestrian density, social groups are further away from the next-closest pedestrian than individuals are, suggesting there is a larger empty space around social groups. These findings suggest when social groups need to be considered in safety management and modelling under normal conditions. At a macroscopic level, described by speed-density relationships, social groups need not be considered explicitly but when considering a microscopic level, including overtaking and personal space, they should be considered explicitly.},

  abstract  = {Closed university buildings proved to be one of the main hot spots for virus transmission during pandemics. As shown during the COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing is one of the most effective measures to limit such transmission. As universities prepare to manage in-class activities, students' adherence to physical distancing requirements is a priority topic. Unfortunately, while physical distancing in classrooms can be easily managed, the movement of students inside common spaces can pose high risk of close proximity. This paper provides an experimental analysis of unidirectional student movement inside a case-study university building to investigate how physical distancing requirements impact student movement and grouping behaviour. Results show general adherence with the minimum required physical distancing guidance, but spaces such as corridors pose higher risk of exposure than doorways. Doorway width, in combination with group behaviour, affect the students' capacity to keep the recommended physical distance. Furthermore, questionnaire results show that students report higher perceived vulnerability while moving along corridors. Evidence-based results can support decision-makers in understanding individuals' exposure to COVID-19 in universities and researchers in developing behavioural models in preparation of future outbreaks and pandemics.},

  abstract     = {The paper investigates the effect of preferential gathering sites on urban insurgency in an agent-based model (ABM). The ABM model was proposed in earlier work and has been validated using FBI data. There is a nonlinear tradeoff between the local density of citizens due to the number of preferential gathering sites and the ability of law enforcement officers (LEOs) to adequately patrol that leads to a non-monotonic behavior in the number of large scale outburst of insurgency with respect to the number of gathering sites. The inclusion of a moderate number of sites decreases the number of large-scale outbursts. Having no gathering sites or a large number of gathering sites has a dilutive effect on the number of large-scale outbursts. Thus, this non-monotonicity indicates that a small number of organized units produces a larger insurgency effect than a larger number of distributed units. It is also shown, using Koopman mode analysis, that the spatial morphology of agents due to the gathering sites gives rise to temporal organization of the model dynamics; there is a prominent quasi-periodic component in the number of active and intimidated citizens and in the spatial distribution of the LEOs.},

To quantitatively assess these mitigation methods, we formulate an agent-based model of customer movement in a supermarket (which we represent by a network) with a simple virus transmission model based on the amount of time a customer spends in close proximity to infectious customers (which we call the exposure time). We apply our model to synthetic store and shopping data to show how one can use our model to estimate exposure time and thereby the number of infections due to human-to-human contact in stores and how to model different store interventions. The source code is openly available under https://github.com/fabianying/covid19-supermarket-abm. We encourage retailers to use the model to find the most effective store policies that reduce virus transmission in stores and thereby protect both customers and staff.},

Studies were made by means of a pedestrian traffic microsimulator (LEGION Studio) and experiments at the Human Dynamic Laboratory (HDL) of Universidad de los Andes in Santiago de Chile, to obtain criteria for the pedestrian traffic management on the platform and doors of metro cars. The methodology consists of building a boarding/alighting hall of a metro car and the relevant portion of the platform in front of the hall. The simulation scenarios included the location of the vertical handrail in the hall of the car, delimitation of a keep out zone in front of the doors and the use of differentiated doors for boarding and alighting. The results of the simulation and laboratory experiments are expressed in Pedestrian Level of Service (LOS), Passenger Service Time (PST), passenger density on the vehicle and platform, and passenger dissatisfaction. Both, the simulation results and laboratory experiments allow us to give some recommendations for the pedestrian traffic management in metro systems.},

The purpose of this paper is to present a simulation model based on hybrid Petri nets able to help transit authorities to carry out performance evaluation procedures in order to prevent, to reduce and if possible to avoid these accidents which deteriorate the image of public transport in general and make it less attractive.},

abstract={The dynamic exit sign has been verified as an effective means to guide the pedestrian during evacuation. The most critical mechanism with dynamic exit sign guidance is to balance the pedestrian flow on each exit route by optimizing the direction of signs. This paper formulates a bi-level programming model for the direction optimization problem of dynamic signs in buildings. In the bi-level program, the upper-level model is a system optimal model, aiming to minimize the total travel time by optimizing the dynamic sign direction. The lower-level model is a pedestrian assignment model satisfying the dynamic user optimal principle that describes the evacuee exit/route choice behaviour to achieve a balanced pedestrian distribution on the route. A method based on the fundamental diagram, the cell transmission model, and the point-queuing theory is developed to estimate evacuation travel time considering congestion and queuing. A heuristic algorithm is extended to solve the bi-level program. Finally, the proposed methodology is validated with numerical examples. Results reveal that the proposed model can produce the optimal dynamic sign direction, significantly improving the evacuation efficiency.},

In the model, the dynamic loading of pedestrian flows on a two-dimensional space is formulated by a cell transmission model, the movement of crowds is driven by space potential, and the optimization of evacuation time is solved by a proportional swapping process. In this way, the proposed model can be applied to not only efficiently optimize the evacuation process of a crowd with large scale but also recognize local congestion dynamics during crowd evacuation. Finally, a set of numerical examples are presented to show the proposed model???s effectiveness for optimizing crowd evacuation process and its application to design a class of variable guide sign systems.},

  abstract     = {The dynamical behavior of social systems can be described by agent-based models. Although single agents follow easily explainable rules, complex time-evolving patterns emerge due to their interaction. The simulation and analysis of such agent-based models, however, is often prohibitively time-consuming if the number of agents is large. In this paper, we show how Koopman operator theory can be used to derive reduced models of agent-based systems using only simulation data. Our goal is to learn coarse-grained models and to represent the reduced dynamics by ordinary or stochastic differential equations. The new variables are, for instance, aggregated state variables of the agent-based model, modeling the collective behavior of larger groups or the entire population. Using benchmark problems with known coarse-grained models, we demonstrate that the obtained reduced systems are in good agreement with the analytical results, provided that the numbers of agents is sufficiently large.},

  abstract     = {The behaviour of building occupants in the first stage of an evacuation can dramatically impact the time required to evacuate buildings. This behaviour has been widely investigated by scholars with a macroscopic approach fitting random distributions to represent the pre-evacuation time, i.e. time from noticing the first cue until deliberate movement. However, microscopic investigations on how building occupants respond to several social and environmental factors are still rare in the literature. This paper aims to leverage machine learning as a possible solution to investigate factors affecting building occupants' decision-making during pre-evacuation stage. In particular, we focus on applying interpretable machine learning to reveal the interactions among the input variables and to capture nonlinear relationships between the input variables and the outcome. As such, we use a well-established machine-learning algorithm?random forest?to model and predict people's emergency behaviour pre-evacuation. We then apply tools to interpret the black-box random forest model to extract useful knowledge and gain insights for emergency planning. Specifically, this algorithm is applied here to investigate the behaviour of 569 building occupants split between five unannounced evacuation drills in a cinema theatre. The results indicate that both social and environmental factors affect the probability of responding. Several independent variables, such as the time elapsed after the alarm has started and the decision-maker's group size, are presenting strong nonlinear relationships with the probability of switching to the response stage. Furthermore, we find interactions exist between the row number where the decision-maker sits and the number of responding occupants visible to her; the complex relationship between the outcome and these two variables can be visualized by using a two-dimensional partial dependence plot. An interesting finding is that a decision-maker is more sensitive to the proportion of responding occupants than the number of them; hence, the people sitting in the back are often responding more slowly than the people in the front.},

Conducted in a strategic area, the survey, as often is the case, collects data that are skewed and face the separation issue???the same outcome always occurs for a particular value of a predictor???according to which estimates by the conventional maximum likelihood (ML) method are inflated. Thus, one mechanical and one statistical alternative are employed: (1) exclusion of a variable that causes separation and (2) estimation by Firth???s penalized method. The two alternatives produce comparable results of the significance testing, that is, p values, but their coefficient estimates considerably differ inasmuch as the mechanical approach used for the ML logistic regression forcefully omits the important variable and subsequently biases the estimates of other predictors. Compared to these ML estimates, empirical findings from the Firth logistic regression are presented in a way that corrects for the ML bias.},

Then, we generated potential alternative routes using a modified labeling approach, measured the route environment through environment auditing and secondary data, estimated two multinomial probit models, and compared the results between the two neighborhoods and between the alternative choice models. It is found that route choice models based on revealed preferences could be a valid and complimentary method for assessing the pedestrian environment, and they could help to prioritize or justify investment related to pedestrian infrastructure. In contrast, contingent rating based on stated preference may overestimate the importance of more tangible attributes, such as distance and safety, because pedestrians were often unable to articulate intangible amenities, such as streetscapes and facade designs. However, route choice modeling seems to perform well only when the pedestrian system offers many route alternatives and pedestrians do have experience with multiple routes.},

abstract = {Existing knowledge on the impact of built environment (BE) on route choice behaviour is doubtful due to an unresolved tension between two schools of thought. One represented BE geographically and found that most people tend to choose the shortest route. The other represented BE topologically and showed that least directional change is a key determinant of route choice. How do pedestrians make a trade-off between these two factors in route choice? This question is answered using walking route data of 178 pedestrians in Brisbane, Australia. Their reported routes were examined against the corresponding shortest path and least directional change routes using the percent overlap method. The effects of 25 additional BE factors were also estimated in a conditional logit model. The results reveal that: (a) Together distance and direction are likely to explain 53% of route choice decisions; (b) Individually, distance and direction are likely to explain 34% and 46% of route choice decisions respectively; (c) 28% of the chosen routes satisfied both distance and direction criteria. These findings confirm the claims of both schools, but also point that the least directional change route is a preferred option, and that pedestrians tend to minimise both criteria if they can.},

Scholars have used either objectively or subjectively measured street environment data without testing their suitability as a substitute for each other in the route choice literature. This study aims to overcome these gaps by investigating the relevance of subjective data as a less-expensive proxy for objective data???together with identifying the factors affecting the degree of disconcordance between them. Subjective street environment data was collected from 178 pedestrians in Brisbane, Australia. Participants were intercepted and requested to draw their walking routes. They were asked to rate the importance of different street environment attributes influencing the chosen route. A range of objective attributes of these routes was derived through virtual audit and spatial analyses. The concordance of 13 seemingly related street environment variables was tested using 'Kappa coefficient' and '\% agreement' methods. Additionally, 13 multinomial logistic regression models were estimated, one for each variable, to identify different factors affecting the level of disconcordance. Results indicate a relatively poor agreement between objective and subjective attributes. However, an objective provisioning of some attributes can improve the perception of pedestrians about these attributes. Estimated regression models show that all groups are to some extent at-risk of being mismatched, suggesting the need for population-based policy interventions to improve perceptions. Findings highlight that subjective measures capture different construct of the street environment than those measured objectively, hence, using these two measures are not comparable.},

Over the last few years, traffic data have been exploding, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation. Existing traffic flow prediction methods mainly use shallow traffic prediction models and are still unsatisfying for many real-world applications. This situation inspires us to rethink the traffic flow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big traffic data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based traffic flow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic traffic flow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent traffic flow features for prediction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for traffic flow prediction has superior performance.",

    abstract = "Sensors deployed in different parts of a city continuously record traffic data, such as vehicle flows and pedestrian counts. We define an unexpected change in the traffic counts as an anomalous local event. Reliable discovery of such events is very important in real-world applications such as real-time crash detection or traffic congestion detection. One of the main challenges to detecting anomalous local events is to distinguish them from legitimate global traffic changes, which happen due to seasonal effects, weather and holidays. Existing anomaly detection techniques often raise many false alarms for these legitimate traffic changes, making such techniques less reliable. To address this issue, we introduce an unsupervised anomaly detection system that represents relationships between different locations in a city. Our method uses training data to estimate the traffic count at each sensor location given the traffic counts at the other locations. The estimation error is then used to calculate the anomaly score at any given time and location in the network. We test our method on two real traffic datasets collected in the city of Melbourne, Australia, for detecting anomalous local events. Empirical results show the greater robustness of our method to legitimate global changes in traffic count than four benchmark anomaly detection methods examined in this paper.",

    abstract = "Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have attracted an increasing amount of attention in recent years. Thanks to the fast development of vehicular computing hardware, vehicular sensors and citywide infrastructures, many impressive applications have been proposed under the topic of ITS, such as Vehicular Cloud (VC), intelligent traffic controls, etc. These applications can bring us a safer, more efficient, and also more enjoyable transportation environment. However, an accurate and efficient traffic flow prediction system is needed to achieve these applications, which creates an opportunity for applications under ITS to deal with the possible road situation in advance. To achieve better traffic flow prediction performance, many prediction methods have been proposed, such as mathematical modeling methods, parametric methods, and non-parametric methods. Among the non-parametric methods, the one of the most famous methods today is the Machine Learningbased (ML) method. It needs less prior knowledge about the relationship among different traffic patterns, less restriction on prediction tasks, and can better fit non-linear features in traffic data. There are several sub-classes under the ML method, such as regression model, kernel-based model, etc. For all these models, it is of vital importance that we choose an appropriate type of ML model before building up a prediction system. To do this, we should have a clear view of different ML methods; we investigate not only the accuracy of different models, but the applicable scenario and sometimes the specific type of problem the model was designed for. Therefore, in this paper, we are trying to build up a clear and thorough review of different ML models, and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of these ML models. In order to do this, different ML models will be categorized based on the ML theory they use. In each category, we will first give a short introduction of the ML theory they use, and we will focus on the specific changes made to the model when applied to different prediction problems. Meanwhile, we will also compare among different categories, which will help us to have a macro overview of what types of ML methods are good at what types of prediction tasks according to their unique model features. Furthermore, we review the useful add-ons used in traffic prediction, and last but not least, we discuss the open challenges in the traffic prediction field.",

The versatility of Gaussian Processes has led to them being used in many varied application domains. However, though many real-world applications involve data which follows a working-week structure, where weekends exhibit substantially different behaviour to weekdays, methods for explicit modelling of working-week effects in Gaussian Process Regression models have not been proposed. Not explicitly modelling the working week fails to incorporate a significant source of information which can be invaluable in forecasting scenarios. In this work we provide novel kernel-combination methods to explicitly model working-week effects in time-series data for more accurate predictions using Gaussian Process Regression. Further, we demonstrate that prediction accuracy can be improved by constraining the non-convex optimisation process of finding optimal hyperparameter values. We validate the effectiveness of our methods by performing multistep prediction on two real-world publicly available time-series datasets - one relating to electricity Smart Meter data of the University of Melbourne, and the other relating to the counts of pedestrians in the City of Melbourne.",

  abstract = {Forecasting the short-term ridership among origin-destination pairs (OD matrix) of a metro system is crucial in real-time metro operation. However, this problem is notoriously difficult due to the high-dimensional, sparse, noisy, and skewed nature of OD matrices. This paper proposes a High-order Weighted Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HW-DMD) model for short-term metro OD matrices forecasting. DMD uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract low-rank approximation from OD data, and a high-order vector autoregression model is estimated on the reduced space for forecasting. To address a practical issue that metro OD matrices cannot be observed in real-time, we use the boarding demand to replace the unavailable OD matrices. Particularly, we consider the time-evolving feature of metro systems and improve the forecast by exponentially reducing the weights for old data. Moreover, we develop a tailored online update algorithm for HW-DMD to update the model coefficients daily without storing historical data or retraining. Experiments on data from a large-scale metro system show the proposed HW-DMD is robust to the noisy and sparse data and significantly outperforms baseline models in forecasting both OD matrices and boarding flow. The online update algorithm also shows consistent accuracy over a long time when maintaining an HW-DMD model at low costs.},

However, deep learning models also have drawbacks that make them less preferable for certain short-term traffic prediction applications. For example, they require a large amount of data for model training, which is also computationally expensive. Moreover, deep learning models lack interpretability of the results. This paper develops a short-term traffic states forecasting algorithm based on partial least square (PLS) to help enhance real-time decision-making and build better insights into traffic data. The proposed model is capable of predicting short-term traffic states accurately and efficiently by capturing dominant spatiotemporal features and day-to-day variations from collinear and correlated traffic data. Three case studies are developed to demonstrate the proposed model in short-term traffic prediction applications.},

One application of our algorithm is the identification of multiple crowd or traffic flows from compressed video streams. Our method uses motion vectors that are readily available in the compressed bitstream, and do not require computationally expensive optical flow. These motion vectors are known to be very noisy, however, our algorithm is able to extract the underlying dynamical systems that define the flows. We formulate a rank regularized dynamic mode decomposition problem with total least squares constraints to estimate the Koopman modes of the motion dynamics. The estimated Koopman modes are then used to analyze the stability of the system and extract steady state and transient flows. We demonstrate the improved performance of our approach compared to state of the art schemes and illustrate it applicability in identifying transient and steady-state flows in real video sequences.",

    abstract = "Traffic prediction has drawn increasing attention in AI research field due to the increasing availability of large-scale traffic data and its importance in the real world. For example, an accurate taxi demand prediction can assist taxi companies in pre-allocating taxis. The key challenge of traffic prediction lies in how to model the complex spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. Although both factors have been considered in modeling, existing works make strong assumptions about spatial dependence and temporal dynamics, i.e., spatial dependence is stationary in time, and temporal dynamics is strictly periodical. However, in practice the spatial dependence could be dynamic (i.e., changing from time to time), and the temporal dynamics could have some perturbation from one period to another period. In this paper, we make two important observations: (1) the spatial dependencies between locations are dynamic; and (2) the temporal dependency follows daily and weekly pattern but it is not strictly periodic for its dynamic temporal shifting. To address these two issues, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Network (STDN), in which a flow gating mechanism is introduced to learn the dynamic similarity between locations, and a periodically shifted attention mechanism is designed to handle long-term periodic temporal shifting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that tackle both issues in a unified framework. Our experimental results on real-world traffic datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

An evolutionary game theoretic model is developed which is then coupled to a pedestrian movement model to examine the collective helping behavior in evacuations. By systematically controlling the number of committed volunteers and payoff parameters, we have characterized and summarized various collective helping behaviors in phase diagrams. From our numerical simulations, we observe that the existence of committed volunteers can promote cooperation but adding additional committed volunteers is effective only above a minimum number of committed volunteers.

Our results are based on hybrid models, combining SIR-type models on local scales with spatial resolution. In order to account for the age-dependence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we include realistic prepandemic and recently recorded contact patterns between age groups. The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions will occur on changed contact patterns, improved isolation, or reduced infectiousness when, e.g., wearing masks. In order to account for spatial heterogeneity, we use a graph approach and we include high-quality information on commuting activities combined with traveling information from social networks. The remaining uncertainty will be accounted for by a large number of randomized simulation runs. Based on the derived factors for the effectiveness of different non-pharmaceutical interventions over the past months, we provide different forecast scenarios for the upcoming time.},

  abstract  = {Agent-based models of group behaviour often lack evidence-based psychological reasons for the behaviour. Similarly, pedestrian behaviour models focus on modelling physical movement while ignoring the psychological reasons leading to those movements (or other relevant behaviours). To improve realism, we need to be able to reflect behaviour as a consequence of feeling part of a psychological group, so we better understand why collective behaviour occurs under different circumstances. The social identity approach has been recognised as a way of understanding within and between group dynamics, as well as the processes that make an individual act as a group member. However, as promising the social identity approach is, the formalisation is a challenging endeavour since different choices can be made to reflect the core concepts and processes. We therefore in this paper elaborate on a few of these formalisation challenges and the choices we made. To support the formalisation and use of social identity approach and finally for the increased realism in group behaviour models, such as pedestrian models that are so heavily used to manage real world crowds.},

Therefore, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based model with human-like perceptron and policy for crowd evacuation in 3D environments (HDRLM3D). In HDRLM3D, we propose a vision-like ray perceptron (VLRP) and combine it with a redesigned global (or local) perceptron (GOLP) to form a human-like perception model. We propose a double-branch feature extraction and decision network (DBFED-Net) as the policy, which can extract features and make behavioral decisions. Moreover, we validate our method's ability to reproduce typical phenomena and behaviors through experiments in two different scenarios. In scenario I, we reproduce the bottleneck effect of crowds and verify the effectiveness and advantages of HDRLM3D by comparing it with real crowd experiments and classical methods in terms of density maps, fundamental diagrams, and evacuation times. In scenario II, we reproduce agents' navigation and obstacle avoidance behaviors and demonstrate the advantages of HDRLM3D for crowd simulation in unknown 3D environments by comparing it with other deep reinforcement learning-based models in terms of trajectories and numbers of collisions.},

  abstract  = {Present day risk assessment on the spreading of airborne viruses is often based on the classical Wells-Riley model assuming immediate mixing of the aerosol into the studied environment. Here, we improve on this approach and the underlying assumptions by modeling the space-time dependency of the aerosol concentration via a transport equation with a dynamic source term introduced by the infected individual(s). In the present agent-based methodology, we study the viral aerosol inhalation exposure risk in two scenarios including a low/high risk scenario of a "supermarket" or "bar". The model takes into account typical behavioral patterns for determining the rules of motion for the agents. We solve a diffusion model for aerosol concentration in the prescribed environments in order to account for local exposure to aerosol inhalation. We assess the infection risk using the Wells-Riley model formula using a space-time dependent aerosol concentration. The results are compared against the classical Wells-Riley model. The results indicate features that explain individual cases of high risk with repeated sampling of a heterogeneous environment occupied by non-equilibrium concentration clouds. An example is the relative frequency of cases that might be called superspreading events depending on the model parameters. A simple interpretation is that averages of infection risk are often misleading. They also point out and explain the qualitative and quantitative difference between the two cases-shopping is typically safer for a single individual person.},

Numerous studies have contributed to a better understanding of the pandemic. In particular, inhalation of aerosolised pathogens has been identified as essential for transmission. This information is crucial to slow the spread, but the individual likelihood of becoming infected in everyday situations remains uncertain. Mathematical models help estimate such risks. In this study, we propose how to model airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a local scale. In this regard, we combine microscopic crowd simulation with a new model for disease transmission. Inspired by compartmental models, we describe virtual persons as infectious or susceptible. Infectious persons exhale pathogens bound to persistent aerosols, whereas susceptible ones absorb pathogens when moving through an aerosol cloud left by the infectious person. The transmission depends on the pathogen load of the aerosol cloud, which changes over time. We propose a 'high risk' benchmark scenario to distinguish critical from non-critical situations. A parameter study of a queue shows that the new model is suitable to evaluate the risk of exposure qualitatively and, thus, enables scientists or decision-makers to better assess the spread of COVID-19 and similar diseases.},

abstract = {Although crowding is often observed in large cities, it is still not known how to control it. Rhythm is a potential method to improve pedestrian flow. This paper investigates the effect of background music on pedestrian movement. Six experiments with different background rhythms and an experiment under normal condition (without any rhythm) are conducted to study the issue. Fundamental diagrams show that velocity and flow with background music at medium and high densities will be smaller than those under normal conditions. With music, stop-and-go behavior is more frequently observed due to a higher stopping headway and a higher restarting headway. Stopping duration analysis shows that pedestrians stop longer with music. Therefore it has to be considered as another factor for jam formation in pedestrian traffic besides density and inhomogeneities. Because of the weaker dynamic coordinate behavior (slower response to the motion of the frontal pedestrians), pedestrians need more time to prevent conflicts and step consecutively at high densities in the presence of music. Decreasing step frequency with rhythm at high density also results in stopping more frequently. Our study will be helpful for understanding the effect of music, especially background music, on pedestrian movement.},

These procedures assume that both the link flows and the proportionate usage of each link made by each origin-destination flow (referred to collectively as the link choice proportions) are known. This paper examines the possibility and methods for estimating the link choice proportions. Three methods are presented: (1) using ad hoc iteration between trip distribution and traffic assignment; (2) combining trip distribution and assignment in one step; (3) solving a new optimization problem in which the path flows are directly considered as variables and its optimal solution is governed by a logit type formula. The algorithms, covergencies and computational efficiencies of these methods are investigated. Results of testing the three methods on example networks are discussed.},

This paper presents a comparison of the fundamental diagrams of pedestrian flow at different locations of Kumbh mela and brings out differences in the flow patterns between a general crowd and a spiritually motivated crowd. The effect of spiritual motivation is reflected in terms of higher speeds of pedestrians at some locations and continuous flow despite higher densities.

This behaviour has been modelled and simulated using a modified social force model which has been developed in this work.

abstract={India hosts many mass religious gatherings, pilgrimages, like Kumbh Mela, Sabarimala, etc. With increased mobility and willingness to travel, the host cities of such gatherings are under tremendous pressure to manage the influx of millions of people. Participants in these gatherings are emotionally driven and if their emotions get aggravated due to situational influences, it may lead to disrupted movements and chaotic situations. Inappropriate or poorly managed crowd control measures may promote risky situations rather than prevent them from mass gatherings. A renewed understanding of crowd behavior in mass religious gatherings is required. Therefore, this white paper aims to assess the effectiveness of the crowd management measures taken by the event organizers and formulate crowd management guidelines for mass religious gatherings. Formulation of crowd management guidelines has been done based on the results from the empirical studies and observations made in the field during the Kumbh Mela 2016 to manage crowds in the future mass religious gatherings.},

title = {Towards Sound-based Crowd Management: Investigating Sonification for Pedestrian Steering},
abstract = {Enabling automated and non-intrusive management of pedestrian flows can help unlock intelligent public environments to maximize individual comfort and wayfinding efficiency. An effective option for this purpose is using dynamic nudging stimuli generated through the use of smart technologies. For this purpose, recent experimental studies have considered visual stimuli to steer pedestrians into alternative walking routes. This research lays the basis for using sonification as a pedestrian flow nudging mechanism. We have developed and deployed a spatialized dynamic sonification to nudge between alternative walking patterns in a real-life work environment endowed with highly accurate and automated pedestrian tracking. In this paper, we report on our preliminary nudging results showing that sound can alter the typical walking trajectories, yet counterintuitively.},

volume = {1},

year = {2022},
month = {08},
abstract = {Routing choices of walking pedestrians in geometrically complex environments are regulated by the interplay of a multitude of factors such as local crowding, (estimated) time to destination, and (perceived) comfort. As individual choices combine, macroscopic traffic flow patterns emerge. Understanding the physical mechanisms yielding macroscopic traffic distributions in environments with complex geometries is an outstanding scientific challenge, with implications in the design and management of crowded pedestrian facilities. In this work, we analyze, by means of extensive real-life pedestrian tracking data, unidirectional flow dynamics in an asymmetric setting, as a prototype for many common complex geometries. Our environment is composed of a main walkway and a slightly longer detour. Our measurements have been collected during a dedicated high-accuracy pedestrian tracking campaign held in Eindhoven (The Netherlands). We show that the dynamics can be quantitatively modeled by introducing a collective discomfort function, and that fluctuations on the behavior of single individuals are crucial to correctly recover the global statistical behavior. Notably, the observed traffic split substantially departs from an optimal, transport-wise, partition, as the global pedestrian throughput is not maximized.},

Having a profound comprehension of the difference between children and adults passing bottlenecks is of great help to improve the safety levels of preschool children. This paper presents an experimental study on the bottleneck flow of pre-school children in a room. The movement characteristics of children's and adults' bottleneck flow are investigated with two macroscopic properties: density and speed profiles as well as microscopic characteristic time: motion activation time, relaxation time, exit travel time and time gap. Arch-like density distributions are observed both for highly motivated children and adults, while the distance between the peak density region and the exit location is shorter for children and longer for adults. Children's movement is less flexible manifested as longer motion activation time and longer relaxation time compared to that of adults. The findings from this study could enhance the understanding of crowd dynamics among the children population and provide supports for the scientific building design for children's facilities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract: In recent years, stabbings have occurred frequently around the world, often causing serious casualties and property losses. Therefore, using evacuation model to simulate and analyze this type of attack mode is of great significance to personnel safety and social stability. However, in the simulation process, the lack of interaction rules between pedestrians and attackers will seriously reduce the accuracy and credibility of the simulation result. Herein, this article focuses on the pedestrian evacuation under stabbings, we proposed a risk field model for pedestrian movement, its formula referred to the continuous point-source diffusion equation in unbounded space. The influence of the surrounding environment on pedestrian movement was considered comprehensively to set the direction of the force exerted by the attacker, pedestrian movement rules and exit selection mechanism were introduced in details. At the same time, we discuss two different attack strategies for attackers, and carried out virtual reality experiments to analyze the experimenter's attack modes and compare them with the two pure strategies. Multiple simulations are conducted on the basis of the model to explore the physical significance of model parameters and the influence of attack mode and location on evacuation, and to explore the mechanism of pedestrians' selection of exits under the condition of multiple exits. At the end of this paper, the simulation results are summarized and suggestions for evacuation under emergencies are provided, which may be helpful to the simulation of pedestrian evacuation under emergencies in the future.},

  abstract     = {Some recent studies have shown that machine learning can achieve higher predictive accuracy than logit models. However, existing studies rarely examine behavioral outputs (e.g., marginal effects and elasticities) that can be derived from machine-learning models and compare the results with those obtained from logit models. In other words, there has not been a comprehensive comparison between logit models and machine learning that covers both prediction and behavioral analysis, two equally important subjects in travel-behavior study. This paper addresses this gap by examining the key differences in model development, evaluation, and behavioral interpretation between logit and machine-learning models for mode-choice modeling. We empirically evaluate the two approaches using stated-preference survey data. Consistent with the literature, this paper finds that the best-performing machine-learning model, random forest, has significantly higher predictive accuracy than multinomial logit and mixed logit models. The random forest model and the two logit models largely agree on several aspects of the behavioral outputs, including variable importance and the direction of association between independent variables and mode choice. However, we find that the random forest model produces behaviorally unreasonable arc elasticities and marginal effects when these behavioral outputs are computed from a standard approach. After the introduction of some modifications that overcome the limitations of tree-based models, the results are improved to some extent. There appears to be a tradeoff between predictive accuracy and behavioral soundness when choosing between machine learning and logit models in mode-choice modeling.},

  abstract     = {Passenger evacuation in a metro tunnel is affected by distinct factors in the environment; thus, it is a huge challenge for both designers and managers throughout the metro system's life cycle. A lateral evacuation platform is usually designed in a modern metro tunnel, and its evacuation efficiency is directly affected by train door opening strategy. By comparing the strategies of opening one, two, three, and four train doors, it is found that opening more doors improves evacuation efficiency. However, when two or more doors are accessed, this can lead to congestion on the evacuation platform near the train door. To reduce the congestion and improve evacuation efficiency, an adaptive train door control policy is proposed in this study, which features an adaptive dynamic programming method, namely, deep q network (DQN). The information of the environment and the state of the train doors are selected as the input and output of the control policy. By simulating scenarios under random, sequence, and DQN policies, the evacuation efficiencies are detailed. Results show that the proposed adaptive control method effectively improves evacuation efficiency. This method helps overcome the disadvantages associated with the fixed train door opening strategy and provides an optimal train door control policy during tunnel evacuation.},

We calibrate and evaluate our approach on a real-life case study - simulating COVID-19 infection transmission in two kinds of scenarios: large-scale (such as the city of Muenster, Germany) and small-scale (such as the most common indoor environments - classrooms, restaurants, etc.).

Here, we present a mesoscale infection transmission model for human occupied indoor spaces, by integrating an agent-based human interaction model with a flow physics model for respiratory droplet dynamics and transport. We outline the mathematical and algorithmic details of the modeling framework, and demonstrate its validity using two simple simulation scenarios that verify each of the major sub-models. We then present a detailed case-study of infection transmission in a model indoor space with 60 human occupants; using a systematic set of simulations representing various flow scenarios. Data from the simulations illustrate the utility and efficacy of the devised mesoscale model in resolving flow-mediated infection transmission; and elucidate key trends in infection transmission dynamics amongst the human occupants.},

  abstract  = {The behavior of people during an evacuation may have a significant impact on evacuation time, so it has been extensively studied using agent-based simulations. This paper aims to use machine learning for predicting agent evacuation time faster in advance, rather than waiting the entire simulation time. We use the well-known machine-learning polynomial regression as our prediction model, and linear regression and decision tree regression as our benchmark models. In order to generate a suitable dataset for training and validating our models, we automate the scenario-creation process from a single template scenario and the simulation output extraction process in the Vadere simulation framework. Our simulation experiments are carried out using the structure plan of the University of M{\"u}nster's administrative building, with up to 100 agents located in a source room as individuals and in groups, attempting to find the shortest path to an exit. We significantly improve evacuation prediction using machine learning regression models in agent-based simulation experiments. Our polynomial regression model can predict evacuation time before the simulation begins, and the prediction results are close to the simulation results, with an average R2 score of 84\%.},

  abstract     = {In the post-epidemic era, people's lives are gradually returning to normal, and travel is gradually resuming. The safe evacuation of cross-regional travelers in railway station has also attracted more and more attention, especially the evacuation behavior of college students in railway station. In this paper, considering the pedestrian dynamics mechanism in the emergency evacuation process during the COVID-19 normalized epidemic prevention and control, an Agent-based social force model was established to simulate the activities of college students in railway station. Combined with the virus infection transmission model, Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate the total exposure time and the number of high-risk exposed people in the railway station evacuation process. In addition, sensitivity analysis was conducted on the total exposure time and the number of high-risk exposed people under 180 combinations of the number of initial infections, social distance, and the proportion of people wearing masks incorrectly. The results show that with the increase of social distances, the total exposure time and the number of high-risk exposures do not always decrease, but increase in some cases. The presence or absence of obstacles in the evacuation scene has no significant difference in the effects on total exposure time and the number of high-risk exposures. During the evacuation behavior of college students in railway station, choosing the appropriate number of lines can effectively reduce the total exposure time and the number of high-risk exposures. Finally, some policy suggestions are proposed to reduce the risk of virus transmission in the railway station evacuation process, such as choosing dynamic and reasonable social distance and the number of queues, and reducing obstacles.},

abstract = {The Social Force Model has been widely used to simulate pedestrian dynamics. Its simplicity and ability to reproduce some collective patterns of behavior make it an adequate tool in the field of pedestrian dynamics. However, its ability to reproduce common macroscopic empirical results, such as pedestrian flows through a bottleneck and the speed-density fundamental diagram, has scarcely been studied. In addition, the effect of each parameter of the model on the dynamics of the system has rarely been shown. In this contribution, a comprehensive parameter-sensitivity analysis in the social force model is provided, and an optimal set is introduced, capable of reproducing both macroscopic experimental flow data and collision avoidance between pedestrians in simple trajectories on the microscopic scale. We show that the incorporation of asymmetric visual range models in the inter-pedestrian interactions is required for quantitative agreement. The model is also capable of showing collision avoidance in simple pedestrian trajectories and lane formation in non-crowded bidirectional pedestrian flows.},

The use, motivations and perceptions associated with these applications have been under investigated due to users being insufficiently involved in their design and development. This paper analyses the extent to which PNAs are used for assisting people to walk, the frequencies and reasons of using these applications, the perceptions about them, and the barriers preventing them from being used. The study is supported by a questionnaire (N = 1438) that was administered in Bologna (Italy) and Porto (Portugal). Results indicated that 42% of the respondents use PNAs mainly on an occasional basis to find locations and the shortest routes. Google Maps was the preferred navigation service. Statistical tests showed that PNAs were more likely to be used by younger adults and students. The lack of need was the main reason for not using these apps, due to the good spatial knowledge of the cities or the non-use of the pedestrian mode for regular trips. Respondents would like to have apps that are more accurate, usable, and adjusted to pedestrian navigation. The findings described in this paper could be helpful for future designs of PNAs, especially to match pedestrian needs more effectively and to enhance the role of these apps in promoting healthier and sustainable lifestyles.},

  abstract  = {Development of non-motorized modes of transportation has recently become a common trait among urban planners toward sustainable transportation, and walkability has been introduced as one of the most interesting concepts in the past two decades. A number of researchers put efforts to develop walkability indices (WIs) to show the status of walkability for specific zones. However, further investigation has not been conducted to account for the effect of trip purposes on WI. The literature presented transportation network design (design), land use diversity (diversity) and population density (density) as main built environment criteria and previous studies have used these criteria to develop different indices to capture walkability. In this paper, the concept of WI is developed based on the zonal walk share. Therefore, a WI has been developed and then calibrated across three specific trip purposes (i.e., job, educational and shopping) in addition to all of the trips on 112 Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) of the city of Rasht, Iran. According to the result of this study, diversity was found to be the most prominent criterion with the WIs. Furthermore, WI was discovered more beneficial for describing the term of walk share in shopping trips than other trip purposes.},

Walkability is a concept that has gained enormous popularity in recent years due to its potential to promote more sustainable urban environments and healthy lifestyles. This paper provides a literature review to analyze the influence of built environment attributes on walkability. The Scopus and Web of Science databases were chosen to survey the peer-reviewed documents published up to June 2020. A total of 132 documents were selected by the search. The review of these 132 documents showed that various built environment attributes were differently analyzed and assessed. More specifically, the search identified 32 built environment attributes that were assessed by using 63 measures. Intersection density, residential density and land use mix were the most used attributes for assessing walkability, namely by using objective methods, such as ratios and spatial score tools. In turn, attributes related to streetscape design and security were much less adopted in walkability assessments. This paper provides additional insights into how built environment attributes influence walkability and identifies gaps and issues that should be analyzed in-depth in the future. The review could be helpful for researchers and urban planners in developing walkability studies and in defining policies to improve walkability.},

Such unfamiliarity can be created through older people travelling as tourists to new areas; as a consequence of urban regeneration; or as a result of cognitive decline, where the familiar becomes unfamiliar. This paper explores the experiences of older people as pedestrians in unfamiliar urban spaces. In looks at two aspects: older people's spatial anxieties and the barriers (physical, psychological, spatial and social) they perceive and encounter in unfamiliar surroundings. Forty-four participants who took part in a reality cave exercise and a sub group of 10 people who visited an unfamiliar area as pedestrians describe their experience of walking a predetermined route. Given increasing urbanisation and population ageing this is an area of importance to geographers and gerontologists.Our study showed that there are a number of barriers that are a concern for older people in new environments; these include poor signage, confusing spaces, poor paving and 'sensory overload' i.e. noise and complexity of the environment. Landmarks and distinctive buildings were more important to participants than signage in navigating unfamiliar areas. Such experiences can contribute to practice implications for planners in designing neighbourhoods to support older people. Small changes such as placing distance on clearly marked signage; giving further information about particular areas beyond the key tourist points and using landmarks as clear navigational aids are important. This paper also adds to the growing literature on geographical gerontology.},

  abstract  = {Amidst the hype and prospects offered by technological innovation for shaping the future of mobility, it can be easy to overlook the humble and enduring place and potential of walking as a means of movement in our mobility system. Yet walking may already be part of the change taking place, as technological innovation and behaviour come together. This paper considers the potential significance of pedestrian navigation that has been placed in the hands of smartphone users, referring to it as 'Walking as a Service' (WaaS). For individuals physically able to, walking can provide a number of positive attributes including independence, reliability, flexibility, exercise and affordability. Such attributes may compare favourably with other means of transport for shorter journeys. Yet in spite of this it is often not the mode of choice. One of its limitations can be the cognitive challenge - when faced with the unfamiliar - of judging how long a journey could take on foot and determining how to navigate to the destination. Google Maps Navigation now addresses this with what appears to be ever improving attention to usability. Audio-visual assistance 'holds your hand' on your journey and keeps track of how far you have left to go and the estimated time needed. With a focus on the UK, the paper explores the prospects for, and place of, WaaS in the future of mobility, also highlighting an apparent sharp increase in average walking trip rate from 2015 to 2018. It draws out a distinction between the business model of Mobility as a Service (MaaS - which sells access to mobility) and that of WaaS (which sells access to geography and consumers) and puts forward the WaaS Circle of Virtue wherein WaaS is able to support sustainability and profitability.},

We found that their navigation performance, their trust in the apps and their experience were all negatively affected. We also identified user strategies to deal with GPS-deteriorated situations and user needs. Based on our findings, we derive several design implications for pedestrian navigation app to better deal with GPS-deteriorated situations. In particular, we propose four adaptation strategies that an app can use to support users in GPS-deteriorated situations. Our findings can benefit designers and developers of pedestrian navigation apps.},

Therefore, the ability to obtain valuable sets of data has become one of the key challenges for researchers. Traditional mobility surveys have many important limitations. In this situation, the potential of the use of smartphones and dedicated applications in the identification of individual travel behaviour seem very promising. We set ourselves a goal to indicate strengths and weaknesses of data obtained with this method and assess the perspectives of its use for the needs of public policies. For these purposes we prepared a low-cost mobile application and conducted a pilot study among students in Pozna\'{n} (Poland). In effect, trajectories of more than 100 people with almost 3 billion of location data were collected. Based on a literature review and our results we discuss the main problems, limitations and challenges of the broader use of the data obtained with smartphones. In the conclusion, we argue that there is a huge and increasing potential connected with mobile phones, but still some important barriers exist including sampling problems, limitations in big data analyses and technological issues. Therefore, a broader use of smartphones in travel behaviour surveys seems to be rather a distant perspective.},

  abstract  = {Reward-based instruments have the potential to encourage individuals' shift towards multimodal mobility options, thus contributing to a more sustainable and resilient transport environment. This paper aims to investigate the effects of reward-based instruments on promoting emerging mobility schemes and active transport, through real-world demonstrations in two European cities. Specifically, a route planning mobile application which tracks users' travel patterns was used to integrate a reward program offering points to incentivize people towards sustainable multimodal choices, including public transport, cycling and walking. In addition, a web-based questionnaire survey was conducted, and a discrete choice model was developed to model individuals' multimodal choice in the presence of different reward types, including monetary rewards, points and the provision of added value services. Overall, our findings indicate that reward-based instruments can contribute to the promotion of sustainable and emerging transport services. In particular, participants spent more time in public transport usage and walking during the reward-based period. Our results indicate that rewards could increase individuals' time spent in public transport usage and walking by about 21 min and 14 min per day respectively. Furthermore, it is found that public transport users were mostly motivated by rewards, while car users and walkers were not motivated towards cycling. Finally, the results indicate that Birmingham's users were more motivated than Vienna's participants, as public transport usage increased by about 209 min per week in Birmingham vs. 74 min per week in Vienna. Similar patterns of increase in the cities were observed for walking, while some population groups in Vienna were found insensitive to the prospect of earning rewards for using sustainable transport modes.},

Several sets of factors such as socio-economic characteristics and travel characteristics are tested and interpreted. Results suggest that smartphone applications mostly influence younger individuals' trip planning decisions. Transit pass owners are the frequent users of smartphone applications for trip planning. Findings suggest that transit pass owners commonly use smartphone applications for deciding departure times and mode choices. The study also identifies the limited impact of smartphone application use on reducing travel outcomes, such as vehicle kilometers traveled. The highest impact is in visiting new places (a 48.8\% increase). The study essentially offers an original in-depth understanding of how smartphone applications are affecting everyday travel.},

It uses data from the Smartphone Use and Travel Choice Survey 2015, which was conducted exclusively on smartphone users of Halifax, Canada. A latent class random parameter logit (LCRPL) modeling technique is applied in this study that provides a better understanding of the effects of smartphone application usage on mobility choices. The model results offer behavioral insights regarding the influence of individuals' attitudes, travel characteristics, built environment and accessibility measures on the relationship between smartphone application usage and mobility choices. For instance, living in the higher mixed land-use areas, individuals are less likely to increase their vehicle kilometers traveled due to smartphone application usage, especially if they are tech savvy. Such individuals tend to increase their participation in social gatherings. One of the unique features of this study is that it explores the effects of individuals' smartphone application usage on mobility choices in terms of their attitudes. The study reveals that in case of people with positive attitude towards sustainable travel, smartphone application usage tends to decrease vehicle kilometers traveled, new place visits and planned group trips, however, increase participation in social gatherings. Results of this study provide critical behavioral insights that could be useful for transportation planners and policy makers to develop flexible policy interventions.},

Fifty-eight participants (20 young adults ages 21-45, 20 younger-old adults ages 61-70, and 18 older-old adults ages 71-80) took part in a simulated navigation task where participants had to go from point A to point B in a virtual city. The task was performed either with a vibrotactile wristband delivering directional messages or with a standard paper map showing the visual instructions to follow. The data showed that vibrotactile guidance instructions improved the correct numbers of turns taken (left/right) at simple intersections. They also reduced travel time as compared with visual guidance instructions provided by a paper map. These benefits were greater among the older-old participants, who had trouble using the paper map and thus benefited greatly from the assistance provided by the vibrotactile guidance instructions. These findings suggest that such an assistance device using simple haptic guidance messages is able to improve older pedestrians' mobility.},

  abstract  = {This article presents an overview of a research project focusing on improving the usability of pedestrian navigation systems by following a User-Centered Design (UCD) approach. One of the main problems with those systems is how to adequately support and enhance the spatial interactions of a traveler to new urban areas, which is crucial for successful self-orienting and wayfinding. The methodology employed allows for conceptualizing, implementing and evaluating research prototypes that aim to satisfy the special user requirements. Outlined in this article are the techniques designed and integrated in the developed prototype, the methods used for their evaluation through field-based studies and the challenges encountered during this process. New techniques with a measurable impact on the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction of navigation were tested and found to dramatically enhance the sense of personal geo-identification in new places. Examples of those techniques are landmark visibility indication, multi-path routing based on time availability, multi-perspective landmark photos and reverse overview + detail maps. Overall, the outcomes of this research verify the capacity of UCD to help overcoming current usability issues with pedestrian navigation systems. By demonstrating an effective UCD methodology and discussing the lessons learned, we intend to aid the development of next generation navigation appliances.},

Many research studies view pedestrian navigation using process-oriented and goal-directed approaches. However, this paper revisits people's needs in pedestrian navigation and classifies their needs as three layers: physical sense layer, physiological safety layer, and mental satisfaction layer according to Maslow's theory. This paper introduces a people-centric framework for pedestrian navigation theory based on these three layers and discusses theoretical challenges for meeting each layer of people's needs. These challenging theories may represent promising and valuable research and promote usage of pedestrian navigation systems or devices in the future.},

Intelligent transport systems navigation services are now directly targeting travelers due to smartphones and their embedded sensors. However, after a decade of research, no universal personal navigation system has been successfully introduced and adopted to improve personal mobility. An analysis of the underlying reasons is conducted, looking at the engineering, human, ethical, and legal challenges. First, contrary to adopting classical mechanization equations linked to solid state physics, location technologies must address complex personal dynamics using connected objects. Second, human factors are often not sufficiently considered while designing new technologies. The needs and abilities of travelers are not systematically addressed from a user-centered perspective. Finally, people want to benefit from location-based services without sharing personal location data to uncontrolled third bodies. Europe is a pioneer in the protection of individuals from personal identification through data processing since location data has been recognized as personal data, but the challenges to enforce the regulation are numerous. The recommendation of 'privacy by design and default' is an interesting key to conceive the universal personal navigation solution. Alternative solutions are highlighted, but they definitively require a more interdisciplinary conception.},

  abstract  = {Navigation systems are ubiquitous tools to assist wayfinders of the mobile information society with various navigational tasks. Whenever such systems assist with self-localization and path planning, they reduce human effort for navigating. Automated navigation assistance benefits navigation performance, but research seems to show that it negatively affects attention to environment properties, spatial knowledge acquisition, and retention of spatial information. Very little is known about how to design navigation systems for pedestrian navigation that increase both navigation performance and spatial knowledge acquisition. To this end, we empirically tested participants (N = 64) using four different navigation system behaviors (between-subject design). Two cognitive processes with varying levels of automation, self-localization and allocation of attention, define navigation system behaviors: either the system automatically executes one of the processes (high level of automation), or the system leaves the decision of when and where to execute the process to the navigator (low level of automation). In two experimental phases, we applied a novel empirical framework for evaluating spatial knowledge acquisition in a real-world outdoor urban environment. First, participants followed a route assisted by a navigation system and, simultaneously, incidentally acquired spatial knowledge. Second, participants reversed the route using the spatial knowledge acquired during the assisted phase, this time without the aid of the navigation system. Results of the route-following phase did not reveal differences in navigation performance across groups using different navigation system behaviors. However, participants using systems with higher levels of automation seemed not to acquire enough spatial knowledge to reverse the route without navigation errors. Furthermore, employing novel methods to analyze mobile eye tracking data revealed distinct patterns of human gaze behavior over time and space. We thus can demonstrate how to increase spatial knowledge acquisition without harming navigation performance when using navigation systems, and how to influence human navigation behavior with varying navigation system behavior. Thus, we provide key findings for the design of intelligent automated navigation systems in real-world scenarios.},

The two experiments discussed within this article helped identify the criteria that govern the relative saliency of features of interest within an urban environment. There are a large variety of features of interest that can be used as directional aids within route descriptions (buildings, statues, monuments, hills, roads, etc). Different measures are therefore required in order to calculate the saliency of the different classes of features. The research revealed that the most important measures of saliency include name, size, age, and colour. The research confirmed that that relative visibility and the direction of approach to the feature also affect a landmark's saliency. The research also highlighted the role that features of interest play in reorientation, confirmatory, and direction-giving tasks.},

In the map-based condition, participants derived route segments from a map (each segment comprising three or four intersections), and then walked the partial routes from memory. After walking, unexpected tests on route memory and survey knowledge were administered. Navigation assistance users showed good route knowledge and poor survey knowledge. In contrast, map users showed better survey knowledge and nearly perfect route knowledge. Variations of information presentation within navigation assistance conditions (auditory vs. visual direction command, additional presentation of allocentric spatial information) was not effective. Results are explained with an active encoding principle. Only information that is actually encoded, transformed, and/or memorized during the primary wayfinding activity, is incidentally learned. Since navigation assistance systems do not require users to encode, transform, and memorize spatial information, the spatial orientation knowledge of navigation assistance users is poor.},

As each navigation task is different, it also requires and can dispense with different map information to support effective and efficient wayfinding. Task-oriented reduction of the elements displayed in a map may therefore support navigation. In order to investigate effects of map reduction on route recognition and visual attention towards specific map elements, we created maps in which areas offside an inserted route were displayed as transparent. In a route memory experiment, where participants had to memorize routes and match them to routes displayed in following stimuli, these maps were compared to unmodified maps. Eye movement analyses revealed that in the reduced maps, areas offside the route were fixated less often. Route recognition performance was not affected by the map reduction. Our results indicate that task-oriented map reduction may direct visual attention towards relevant map elements at no cost for route recognition.},

In this article, a compact but comprehensive collection of available methods to build each component is summarized.

In this paper we describe a methodology for the implementation of haptics in four distinct prototypes for pedestrian navigation. Prototypes are classified based on the user's navigation guidance requirements, the user type (based on spatial skills), and overall system complexity. Here haptics is used to convey location, orientation, and distance information to users using pedestrian navigation applications. Initial user trials have elicited positive responses from the users who see benefit in being provided with a 'heads up' approach to mobile navigation. We also tested the spatial ability of the user to navigate using haptics and landmark images based navigation. This was followed by a test of memory recall about the area. Users were able to successfully navigate from a given origin to a Destination Point without the use of a visual interface like a map. Results show the users of haptic feedback for navigation prepared better maps (better memory recall) of the region as compared to the users of landmark images based navigation.},

  abstract  = {Navigation systems help agents find the right (optimal) path from the origin to the desired destination. Current navigation systems mainly offer the shortest (distance or time) path as the default optimal path. However, under certain circumstances, having a least-top-exposed path can be more interesting. For instance, on a rainy day, a path with as many places as possible covered by roofs/shelters is more attractive and pragmatic, since roofs/shelters can offer protection from rain. In this paper, we name environments that covered by roofs/shelters but not completely enclosed like indoors as &ldquo;top-bounded environments/spaces&rdquo; (e.g., porches), which are generally formed by built structures. This kind of space is completely missing in current navigation models and systems. Thus, we investigate how to use it for space-based navigation. After proposing a definition, a space model, and attributes of top-bounded spaces, we introduce a projection-based approach to generate them. Then, taking a pedestrian as an example agent, we select generated spaces considering whether the agent can visit/use the identified spaces. Finally, examples and a use case study demonstrate that our research can help to include top-bounded spaces in navigation systems/models. More navigation path types (e.g., least-top-exposed) can be offered for different agents (such as pedestrians, drones or robots).},

In most cases when people use vehicles, the shortest path may really be the most relevant, but in case of pedestrians, we are less protected from environment and the factors like noise level, air quality, beauty and safety of route are coming to the fore. Moreover, in most cases we consider several factors deciding which route to choose: we need silent and green at the same time, beautiful as well as illuminated and etc. In most studies this factors are taking into account separately. In our research, using an example of Saint-Petersburg, we developed the prototype application suggesting attractive walking route for pedestrians considering the combination of different factors besides it's length. To estimate true score of places from the point of walking attractiveness we conducted a questionnaire, and collected scores of attractiveness in the different places of the city. The acquired samples were used to create model defining attractiveness of place by combination of different factors such as noise, architecture, density of photos and proximity of water bodies as well as green and industrial zones. The model created by Random Forest algorithm classifies places in three groups: attractive, mid-attractive and non-attractive with f1 - scores about 0.6; Using this model, we determined the attractiveness index of all of the footways in the city. To create navigation algorithm and design mobile application we applied classic Dijkstra's shortest path finding algorithm with cost weighted by attractiveness index of footways. The preliminary estimation of algorithm shows that provided routes are 14\% more attractive and just 6\% longer than the shortest ones.},

  abstract  = {Smart and sustainable mobility have recently emerged as a solution to the problems incurred by the intensive use of motorised transport modes. For many decades, cities have been planned based on the needs of vehicle traffic, neglecting basic human needs for active mobility and the adverse effects of motorised traffic on the natural environment. However, walking is an environmentally friendly transport mode and a healthy form of making physical activity. Thus, walking becomes an essential component of the transport and urban policies for achieving a more sustainable development process. This paper presents the research project Smart Pedestrian Network (SPN) that aims at promoting walkability as one of the critical dimensions of smart and sustainable mobility in cities. The paper analyses the various components linked to SPN that can make a pedestrian network ``smart'' and, therefore, a feasible alternative to motorised transport modes. Three integrated components are analysed: (i) an urban planning component supported in a GIS-based multi-criteria model to assess the conditions provided to pedestrians and to support the adoption of planning policies; (ii) a smartphone app for pedestrian navigation, displaying optional routes according to the pedestrian preferences and needs; and (iii) a business component to estimate and disseminate the multiple benefits of walking as well as the market potential of SPN. By promoting an innovative linkage of these three components, SPN has a great potential for improving walkability and, therefore, for creating more sustainable and liveable urban spaces.},

  abstract  = {Smartphone use while walking (i.e., being a smartphone zombie) has become a prevalent phenomenon in many cities worldwide. Previous research shows that many pedestrians choose to interact with their phones as they walk around in cities, despite being aware that their behavior might be dangerous. To investigate potential reasons for the prevalence of distracted walking, the current study explores the construct Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) as a potential antecedent of pedestrians' smartphone use while walking. Hierarchical OLS and logistic regression analyses show that FoMO predicts distracted walking, the tendency to engage in virtual social interactions while walking, and dangerous traffic incidents irrespective of participants age and gender. Virtual communication might serve as a compensation for real-world company, thus sidelining the need to traverse safely.},

  abstract  = {Mobile phones usages are emerging as fast as the evolution of a man. Starting from the sunrise to sunset people are constantly using the mobile phone. It has more features like gaming, music, camera, alarm, etc. and people are using it to perform their day-to-day tasks. Even though the mobile phone has a lot of benefits, it also leads to life threatening problems due to pedestrian collision. The probability of such incidents may happen, when the pedestrians are not taking their eyes form the mobile phone while walking or crossing the road, so they met with an accident which causes serious injuries. To avoid such happenings and to notify the pedestrians about the obstacles, a mobile application called Pedwarn is developed with the help of built in phone sensors like accelerometer sensor, gyroscope sensor. It provides solutions to the problem without prior knowledge of the surroundings by calculating the distance to the nearby objects with phone speakers and microphones. The obstacles are detected within 2-4 m. Its accuracy is also strengthened by using the visual detector which will capture the images of the surrounding with the rear camera. Pedwarn is evaluated using variety of environmental settings and in different devices which are common in our day to day surroundings. The power consumed by each and every component is measured periodically of about one hour. Averages of Pedwarn measurements is noted that, its detection accuracy is 95\% higher and 2\%.},

LOD 1 of 3D representations of city buildings are presented into a 2.5D map for pedestrian navigation test. This 3D map display is evaluated against familiar 2D map system on the test participants smartphones. 16 participants were involved in the field test. The typical walking model of a searching task that is focused only to look for a certain address of building is chosen as the way finding model during the field test. Three kinds of navigation processes i.e. self-orientation, spatial knowledge acquisition and navigation decision for searching task were evaluated for each test participant. Usability measures of 3D map-based display over 2D-map based display for pedestrian navigation were collected from test participants mobile devices. In addition to that, activities of test participants in terms of acceleration and orientation information are used to support analysis of pattern and trends of test participants. As the testing app is also intended to support smart city application, its ability to provide user report on complaints was also assessed. Most participants agreed with the statements in the questionnaire that were organized into three sections, i.e. addressing participants' interaction, participants responses in navigation processes and crowdsensing. The results suggest that 3D map-based pedestrian navigation is more usable to be used to look for a certain address of building in central tourist area of urban city.},

Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that when users feel they are in control of their path, both performance and overall experience would improve. We found that both conditions increased the navigation performance and experience, decreased travel time, errors, and confusion and it increased the number of landmarks noticed.},

  note      = {The term usability is used to describe how the product influences user acceptance in using the product (Folmer and Bosch 2004). There have been many variations in defining usability attributes. Usability attributes as defined in ISO 9241 refer to effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction with which targeted users achieve specified goals in particular environments. Quesenbery (2004) defines the usability as the 5Es: effective, efficient, engaging, error tolerant, and easy to learn. In order to check whether the intended product or a service meet the required usability attributes against the expected users, usability evaluation is done. Usability refers to the technical aspects of a visualization (Bleisch 2012). Usability of pedestrian navigation has been evaluated in (Delikostidis et al. 2013) by investigating the influence of landmark visibility to improve navigation usability and in (Liao et al. 2017) by exploring differences in the use of 2D and 3D maps in pedestrian navigation. Usability evaluation on the effectiveness in using different map displays has been applied to reveal usability attributes of the 5Es effective, efficient, engaging, error tolerant, and easy to learn (Aditya 2010). Similar evaluation is conducted in this research to understand user preferences and requirements for better LOD 1 of 2.5D map-based navigation over 2D map-based navigation. This LOD 1 of 2.5D map-based navigation is simply called 3D navigation in this paper.},

This paper aims to pinpoint and understand the drivers that influence individuals travel decisions when using travel apps including both travel information and persuasive features. The analytical framework relies on Lindenberg's goal-framing theory in which individuals motives for using travel apps are grouped into three overarching goals, namely (1) gain, (2) hedonic and (3) normative goal-frames. Furthermore, technophile attitude, community trust and place attachment are incorporated into the framework in order to better explain user-sided heterogeneity. The case-study focuses on the travel information system under development in Copenhagen (Denmark). It questions 822 Danish travelers by distributing a technology-use preference survey. Structural equation models revealed that the choice motivators are specific to individual users and depend on wide ranging factors that go beyond traditional economic and socio-demographic methods. The study reveals: (i) trip efficiency improvement, enjoyment, social interaction and environmentally-friendly travel promotion are important motives for using the new app; (ii) individuals have different intentions according to the perceived value of the new information system as well as travel purposes; (iii) technophile attitude exerts a positive influence on both user motives and use intention; (iv) social and institutional trust in addition to an affective bond to the city influence the use intention of the travel app.},

  abstract  = {3D representations in applications that provide self-localization and orientation in wayfinding have become increasingly popular in recent years because of technical advances in the field. However, human factors have been largely ignored while designing 3D representations in support of pedestrian navigation. This exploratory study aims to explore gender effects on using 3D maps for spatial orientation. We designed a 3D map that combines salient 3D landmarks and 2D layouts, and evaluated gender differences in their performance during direction-pointing tasks by administrating an eye tracking experiment. The results indicate there was no significant overall gender difference on performance and visual attention. However, we observed that males using the 3D map paid more attention to landmarks in the environment and performed better than when using the conventional 2D map, whereas female performance did not show any significant difference between the two types of map usage. We also observed contrary gender differences in visual attention on landmarks between the 3D and 2D maps. While males fixated longer on landmarks than females when using the 3D map, females paid more visual attention to landmarks than males when using the 2D map. In addition, verbal protocols showed that males had more confidence while make decisions. These empirical results can be helpful in the design of map-based wayfinding enhancement tools.},

The results of an online questionnaire showed that women were equally optimistic about embracing technology. However, they rated themselves higher on discomfort and insecurity and lower on innovativeness. We also examined the perceived usefulness of navigation aids. For example, both men and women found mobile maps useful, but men found paper maps more useful than women. Women were more likely than men to feel that using Google Maps increased safety. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that women are less ready to embrace technology, rather it depends on its usefulness for the task at hand.},

  title     = {Mobile apps and transportation: A review of smartphone apps and a study of user response to multimodal traveler information},
  abstract  = {In recent years, technological and social forces have pushed smartphone applications (apps) from the fringe to the mainstream. Understanding the role of transportation apps in urban mobility is important for policy development and transportation planners. This study evaluates the role and impact of multimodal aggregators from a variety of perspectives, including a literature review; a review of the most innovative, disruptive, and highest-rated transportation apps; interviews with experts in the industry, and a user survey of former multimodal aggregator RideScout users. Between February and April 2016, researchers conducted interviews with experts to gain a stronger understanding about challenges and benefits of data sharing between private companies and public agencies. Key findings from the expert interviews include the critical need to protect user privacy; the potential to use data sharing to address integrated corridor and congestion management as well as various pricing strategies during peak hours; along with the potential benefits for improving coordination between the public and private sectors. In March 2016, researchers surveyed 130 people who had downloaded the RideScout app to evaluate attitudes and perceptions toward mobile apps, travel behavior, and modal shift. The goal was to enhance understanding of how the multimodal apps were impacting the transportation behavior. The survey did found that respondents used multimodal apps in ways that yielded travel that was less energy intensive and more supportive of public transit. Looking to the future, smartphone applications and more specifically multimodal aggregators, may offer the potential for transportation planners and policymakers to enhance their understanding of multimodal travel behavior, share data, enhance collaboration, and identify opportunities for public-private partnerships.},

The aim of this paper is to examine the extent to which walking is used as a transport mode for short urban trips in the city centers of Bologna and Porto and the barriers preventing utilitarian walking. Based on a questionnaire (n = 1117) administered in the two cities, results indicated that 21\% of the individuals travel by foot, while 47\% combine walking with other modes. This means that 68% of the daily trips to these city centers involve walking activity. From the overall trips, 84% were made to reach work and school/university. Statistical tests showed that utilitarian walkers were more likely to be females (p < 0.001) and undergraduates (p < 0.001). People from Bologna were more likely to engage in utilitarian walking than people from Porto (p < 0.001). Travel distance and time were the main barriers preventing people from engaging in utilitarian walking. The findings described in this paper provide a better understanding of utilitarian walking in the central areas of both cities, which can guide policies to promote healthier lifestyles and sustainable mobility.},

Based on the classification, a two-stage route choice process is proposed, in which the first step is to classify the travelers and the second one is to model route choice behavior. After analyzing the characteristics of different types of travelers, an artificial neural network was adopted to classify travelers and model route choice behavior. An empirical study using global position systems data collected in Minneapolis-St Paul metropolitan area was carried out. It finds that most travelers follow the same route during commute trips on successive days. And different types of travelers have a significant difference in route choice property.

In a series of studies, participants navigated a real and a virtual environment using a paper map and a navigation app on a smartphone. We measured the differences in navigation performance, task load and spatial knowledge acquisition between RL and VR. From these we formulate guidelines for the improvement of pedestrian navigation systems in VR like improved legibility for small screen devices. We furthermore discuss appropriate low-cost and low-space VR-locomotion techniques and discuss more controllable locomotion techniques.},

The data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire and a total of 260 were valid for analysis. T-tests were applied to investigate differences between males and females as well as between undergraduates and postgraduate Generation Y students. The findings revealed no statistically significant differences between males and females regarding usage intention of branded mobile apps. However, regarding education level, undergraduate and postgraduate students differed significantly regarding usage intention of branded mobile apps. Therefore, it is recommended that the Generation Y cohort should be kept in mind when developing mobile apps, as this generation represents a significant number of those who use branded mobile apps.},

We exploit mobile application usage logs provided by a Wi-Fi local area network service provider to characterize temporal behavior of mobile applications. More specifically, we generate daily profiles of 'what' types of mobile applications users access and when users access them. From these profiles, we create usage classes of mobile applications via aggregation of similar profiles depending on data consumption rate, using three clustering techniques that we compare. Furthermore, we show that we can utilize these classes to analyze and predict future usages of each mobile application through progressive comparison using distance and similarity comparison techniques. Finally, we also detect and exploit outlying behavior in application usage profiles and discuss methods to efficiently predict them.},

Nevertheless, contemporary digital maps over-emphasize the needs of motor vehicles. Pedestrian routes have only been considered as an add-on option in existing digital maps and the respective data collection has not been performed in the field. In this article, we present a mobile application that employs gamification as a means to engage users to collect pragmatic data about walkable routes, which are then processed with the goal of creating a new kind of pedestrian-friendly cartography. Besides the technical infrastructure for collecting and filtering the route traces, the main challenge in user-generated walkable routes is the identification of malicious data, which should be rejected, as well as the rewarding of constructive behavior through peer-review. For this purpose, the mobile application employs a point system in order to identify and discourage the submission of bad routes. A longitudinal (2-months) field study of the mobile application confirmed that gamification facilitates effective data collection for producing pedestrian cartography even with few users and demonstrated that gamification infuses a shared responsibly about the quality of data collection. The visualization of the pedestrian-generated data on a map required a partially manual process, thus, further research should explore the gamification of the data visualization part, too.},

PNS, while overlap in functionality with vehicle navigation services, must be designed specifically for the wayfinding and navigational needs and preferences of pedestrians. One major shortcoming of most existing PNS in outdoors is that they utilize and provide services based on road networks, resulting in PNS that do not effectively and properly track pedestrians as they usually walk on sidewalks, which have more segments and are narrower than roads. Challenges in building PNS include constructing appropriate sidewalk networks, continually tracking users in real time on sidewalks without interruption, and providing personalized routes as well as directions. In this paper, these challenges are highlighted and current trends in PNS, for both outdoors and indoors, are discussed and analyzed. A prototype PNS designed for the University of Pittsburg's main campus sidewalk network (PNS-Pitt) is also discussed},

To ensure that these services are successful, it is necessary to understand the information requirements of pedestrians when navigating, and in particular, what information they need and how it is used. A requirements study was undertaken to identify these information requirements within an urban navigation context. Results show that landmarks were by far the most predominant navigation cue, that distance information and street names were infrequently used, and that information is used to enable navigation decisions, but also to enhance the pedestrian's confidence and trust. The implications for the design of pedestrian navigation aids are highlighted.},

Based on a proposed conceptual model, urban pedestrian wayfinding experiments have been implemented in an immersive virtual reality test environment. Automated and semi-automated methods of data collection have allowed an integrated picture of participant behaviour and information preferences to be constructed and analysed. The results of this study show that there are clear user preferences in information requirements in completing wayfinding tasks. However, changes in user preferences during the wayfinding tasks do occur in response to levels of confidence, different spatial layouts and the wayfinding situations individuals encounter. The outcomes indicate that the proposed conceptual interaction model and adopted implementation approach assist in understanding user behaviour and information preferences for LBS.},

More concretely, we develop a method to infer the global number of new infections from patchy observations, by coupling ad hoc spatial models for disease transmission via respiratory droplets to detailed field-data about pedestrian trajectories and head orientations. This allows us to rank the investigated situations by the infection risks that they present; importantly, the obtained hierarchy of risks is very largely conserved across transmission models: Street cafes present the largest average rate of new infections caused by an attendant, followed by busy outdoor markets, and then metro and train stations, whereas the risks incurred while walking on fairly busy streets are comparatively quite low. While our models only approximate the actual transmission risks, their converging predictions lend credence to these findings. In situations with a moving crowd, density is the main factor influencing the estimated infection rate. Finally, our study explores the efficiency of street and venue redesigns in mitigating the viral spread: While the benefits of enforcing one-way foot traffic in (wide) walkways are unclear, changing the geometry of queues substantially affects disease transmission risks.},

abstract = {To improve occupant safety during building emergencies, evacuation simulations have been widely used for building safety design. Since occupant behavior is a determining factor for the outcome of building emergencies, accurately capturing how occupants make decisions and integrating occupants' decision-making processes in evacuation simulations is important. In this study, based on the results of fire evacuation experiments in a virtual metro station, how different social (crowd flow) and environmental (visual access and vertical movement) factors would affect individuals' wayfinding behavior was predicted using machine learning and discrete choice models. The trained models were further employed in agent-based evacuation simulations to examine crowd evacuation performance under different building design scenarios. Both the machine learning and discrete choice models could accurately predict individuals' directional choices during emergency evacuations. Different building attributes could collectively influence occupant behavior, leading to distinct exit choices and evacuation times. While both the trained machine learning and discrete choice models generated similar results, the discrete choice model had better interpretability. Moreover, by comparing the trained models in this study with a model developed in a prior study, it was found that agents had significantly distinct responses to different building designs. Critical factors (e.g., type and size of buildings, occupants' familiarity with the building) for the applicability of evacuation models were identified. Furthermore, recommendations were provided for future research that aims at employing evacuation simulations for building design evaluation and optimization.}

However, I will show, based on a variety of metrics, that not only has this not been the case, but also, the first two years of the pandemic have posed an undisputable setback to the development and growth of crowd science. Without intervention, this could potentially aggravate further and cause a long-lasting recession in this field. This article, in addition to documenting and highlighting this issue, aims to outline potential avenues through which crowd research can reshape itself in the era of Covid-19 pandemic, maintain its pre-pandemic momentum and even further expand the diversity of its topics. Despite significant changes that the pandemic has brought to human life, issues related to congregation and mobility of pedestrians, building fires, crowd incidents, rallying crowds and the like have not disappeared from societies and remain relevant. Moreover, the diversity of pandemic-related problems itself creates a rich ground for making novel scientific discoveries. This could provide grounds for establishing fresh dimensions in crowd dynamics research. These potential new dimensions extend to all areas of this field including numerical and experimental investigations, crowd psychology and applications of computer vision and artificial intelligence methods in crowd management. The Covid-19 pandemic may have posed challenges to crowd researchers but has also created ample potential opportunities. This is further evidenced by reviewing efforts taken thus far in pandemic-related crowd research.},

In our contribution, we focus on the time-critical process of aircraft boarding, where regulations regarding physical distances between passengers will significantly increase boarding time. The passenger behavior is implemented in a field-validated stochastic cellular automata model, which is extended by a module to evaluate the transmission risk. We propose an improved boarding process by considering that most of the passengers are travel together and should be boarded and seated as a group. The NP-hard seat allocation of groups with minimized individual interactions between groups is solved with a genetic algorithm. Then, the improved seat allocation is used to derive an associated boarding sequence aiming at both short boarding times and low risk of virus transmission. Our results show that the consideration of groups will significantly contribute to a faster boarding (reduction of time by about $60\%$) and less transmission risk (reduced by $85\%$) compared to the standard random boarding procedures applied in the pandemic scenario.},

The confined space conditions in the aircraft cabin necessitate a small physical distance between passengers and hence may boost virus transmissions. In our contribution, we implemented a transmission model in a virtual aircraft environment to evaluate the individual interactions between passengers during aircraft boarding and deboarding. Since no data for the transmission is currently available, we reasonably calibrated our model using a sample case from 2003. The simulation results show that standard boarding procedures create a substantial number of possible transmissions if a contagious passenger is present. The introduction of physical distances between passengers decreases the number of possible transmissions by approx. $75\%$ for random boarding sequences, and could further decreased by more strict reduction of hand luggage items (less time for storage, compartment space is always available). If a second door is used for boarding and deboarding, the standard boarding times could be reached. Individual boarding strategies (by seat) could reduce the transmission potential to a minimum, but demand for complex pre-sorting of passengers. Our results also exhibit that deboarding consists of the highest transmission potential and only minor benefits from distance rules and hand luggage regulations.},

The model also takes into account the pushing behavior appearing at extremely high densities. The main novelty is that pedestrians are not assumed to generate any kind of "field" which governs the dynamics of the others in the space around them. Instead, the behavior of each pedestrian solely relies on its knowledge of the environment and the evaluation of interpersonal distances between it and the others. The model is able to the concave/concave fundamental diagram with a "double hump" (i.e. with a second peak) which shows up when body forces come into play. We present several numerical tests (some of them being inspired by the recent ISO 20414 standard), which show how the model can reproduce classical self-organizing patterns.},

  abstract = {Introduction We raise the question of whether an escaping crowd can benefit from a mixture (or heterogeneity) of direction-choice-making strategies, and if so, how would an optimal composition of strategies be like.
Methods: 
We perform extensive computer simulation analyses and examine crowds of evacuees composed of two different behavioural classes in terms of their direction-choice strategies. We examine three possible strategies: (I) follow the majority (II) follow the minority without the possibility of decision update and (III) follow the minority with the possibility of decision update.
Findings: Results showed that the types of escape decision strategy and their composition in the crowd vastly impacted on the efficiency of the evacuation process. The numerical analyses showed the followings: (1) The highest degree of optimality was achieved from a homogenous crowd of minority followers with the possibility of decision update.
(2) The magnitude of the detriment resulted from greater concentrations of the follow-the-majority strategy in the crowd was much larger than the benefit of having more of the follow-the-minority strategy. (3) The marginal benefit of increasing the concentration of the follow-the-minority strategy largely diminished once this strategy became dominant in the crowd. A substantial portion of this benefit was realised at about 50 percent concentration level. (4) The system's efficiency was more sensitive to the behavioural strategy when there was only a one-off chance of direction-choice making.
Applications:
These findings have implications for evacuation management. They offer quantitative evidence on how training or modifying individuals' decision-making behaviour can potentially facilitate evacuation processes. They provide insight into ideal (or optimum) forms of behaviour.},

  abstract = {Pedestrian groups are commonly found in crowds but research on their social aspects is comparatively lacking. To fill that void in literature, we study the dynamics of collision avoidance between pedestrian groups (in particular dyads) and individual pedestrians in an ecological environment, focusing in particular on (i) how such avoidance depends on the group's social relation (e.g. colleagues, couples, friends or families) and (ii) its intensity of social interaction (indicated by conversation, gaze exchange, gestures etc). By analyzing relative collision avoidance in the "center of mass" frame, we were able to quantify how much groups and individuals avoid each other with respect to the aforementioned properties of the group. A mathematical representation using a potential energy function is proposed to model avoidance and it is shown to provide a fair approximation to the empirical observations. We also studied the probability that the individuals disrupt the group by "passing through it" (termed as intrusion). We analyzed the dependence of the parameters of the avoidance model and of the probability of intrusion on groups' social relation and intensity of interaction. We confirmed that the stronger social bonding or interaction intensity is, the more prominent collision avoidance turns out. We also confirmed that the probability of intrusion is a decreasing function of interaction intensity and strength of social bonding. Our results suggest that such variability should be accounted for in models and crowd management in general. Namely, public spaces with strongly bonded groups (e.g. a family-oriented amusement park) may require a different approach compared to public spaces with loosely bonded groups (e.g. a business-oriented trade fair).},

A comparison of different group compositions showed that the effect of gender can only be seen, if at all, in a small density interval. Regression analyses were also conducted to determine whether, at high densities, the distance between individuals depends on the gender of the neighboring pedestrians and to establish which human factors have an effect on the velocity. An analysis of the distances between individuals at high densities indicated that there was no effect of the gender of the neighboring pedestrians.

We introduce a minimal model based on mean-field games, emulating agents planning out a global strategy that minimizes their overall discomfort. By solving the problem in the permanent regime thanks to an elegant analogy with the nonlinear Schr?dinger's equation, we are able to identify the two main variables governing the model's behavior and to exhaustively investigate its phase diagram. We find that, compared to some prominent microscopic approaches, the model is remarkably successful in replicating the experimental observations associated with the intruder experiment.

  abstract     = {Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus causing a global pandemic in 2020, is predominantly transmitted via airborne aerosols in indoor environments. This calls for novel strategies when assessing and controlling a building's indoor air quality (IAQ). IAQ can generally be controlled by ventilation and/or policies to regulate human-building-interaction. However, in a building, occupants use rooms in different ways, and it may not be obvious which measure or combination of measures leads to a cost- and energy-effective solution ensuring good IAQ across the entire building. Therefore, in this article, we introduce a novel agent-based simulator, ArchABM, designed to assist in creating new or adapt existing buildings by estimating adequate room sizes, ventilation parameters and testing the effect of policies while taking into account IAQ as a result of complex human-building interaction patterns. A recently published aerosol model was adapted to calculate time-dependent carbon dioxide (CO2) and virus quanta concentrations in each room and inhaled CO2 and virus quanta for each occupant over a day as a measure of physiological response. ArchABM is flexible regarding the aerosol model and the building layout due to its modular architecture, which allows implementing further models, any number and size of rooms, agents, and actions reflecting human-building interaction patterns. We present a use case based on a real floor plan and working schedules adopted in our research center. This study demonstrates how advanced simulation tools can contribute to improving IAQ across a building, thereby ensuring a healthy indoor environment.},

In order to assess the risks associated with this pathway in daily-life settings involving tens to hundreds of individuals, the chasm needs to be bridged between fluid dynamical simulations and population-scale epidemiological models. This is achieved by simulating droplet trajectories at the microscale in numerous ambient flows, coarse-graining their results into spatio-temporal maps of viral concentration around the emitter, and coupling these maps to field-data about pedestrian crowds in different scenarios (streets, train stations, markets, queues, and street cafes). At the individual scale, the results highlight the paramount importance of the velocity of the ambient air flow relative to the emitter's motion. This aerodynamic effect, which disperses infectious aerosols, prevails over all other environmental variables. At the crowd's scale, the method yields a ranking of the scenarios by the risks of new infections, dominated by the street cafes and then the outdoor market. While the effect of light winds on the qualitative ranking is fairly marginal, even the most modest air flows dramatically lower the quantitative rates of new infections.},

  abstract    = {Terrorist attacks have become more frequent and more deadly in recent decades.
Understanding the movement responses of the individuals involved can save
lives.
Pedestrian dynamics is an area of research and industry that investigates
the movement of people. Using pedestrian dynamics to predict the responses
to terrorist attacks could be hugely beneficial to the survival of those involved.
This PhD developed a generalised methodology for investigating movement
responses to terrorist attacks, accommodating the wide range of attack vectors
seen in modern terrorism and providing a detailed summary of the data that
should be obtained.
Initial work analysed the overlap between pedestrian dynamics and terrorism.
This concluded that current interdisciplinary research is not suffciently
advanced to allow for accurate predictions of pedestrian movement responses
to terrorist attacks, due to a lack of usable data given the sensitivity of previous
incidents and limitations on experimental methodologies.
Two sets of experiments were then performed, examining responses to knifebased
attacks by an unexpected and hostile individual. These experiments
were split into physical reality (PR) and virtual reality (VR). The PR experiments
were performed in December 2018 with 80 participants, and the VR
experiments in January-February 2020 with 55 participants.
The experiments obtained positional, physiological, psychological and memoryrelated
measurements. Analysis of these datasets investigated the participant
responses to hostile aggressors, including the impact of demographic,
emotional state, and the similarity in responses between the VR and PR
paradigms.
The analysis on the psychological and physiological datasets proved a stressed
response to the hostile individual, resulting in the first ever experimental
dataset for these. The subsequent analysis on the positional and memoryrelated
datasets provided key inputs for pedestrian dynamics models and concluded that VR is 
appropriate as a data-generating tool for human behaviour
in emergencies.},

  abstract     = {As the rapid-spreading disease COVID-19 occupies the world, most governments adopt strict control policies to alleviate the impact of the virus. These policies successfully reduced the prevalence and delayed the epidemic peak, while they are also associated with high economic and social costs. To bridge the microscopic epidemic transmission patterns and control policies, simulation systems play an important role. In this work, we propose an agent-based disease simulator for indoor public spaces, which contribute to most of the transmission in cities. As an example, we study Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, which is one of the most bustling aviation hubs in China. Specifically, we design a high-efficient mobility generation module to reconstruct the individual trajectories considering both lingering behavior and crowd mobility, which greatly enhances the credibility of the simulated mobility and ensures real-time performance. Based on the individual trajectories, we propose a multi-path disease transmission module optimized for indoor public spaces, which includes three main transmission paths as close contact transmission, aerosol transmission and object surface transmission. We design a novel convolution-based algorithm to mimic the diffusion process, which can leverage the high concurrent capability of the graphics processing unit (GPU) to accelerate the simulation process. Leveraging our simulation paradigm, the effectiveness of common policy interventions can be quantitatively evaluated. For mobility interventions, we find that lingering control is the most effective mobility intervention with (32.35\% ) fewer infections, while increasing social distance and increasing walking speed have a similar effect with (15.15\% ) and (18.02\% ) fewer infections. It demonstrates the importance of introducing crowd mobility into disease transmission simulation. For transmission processes, we find the aerosol transmission involves in (99.99\% ) of transmission, which highlights the importance of ventilation in indoor public spaces. Our simulation also demonstrates that without strict entrance detection to identify the input infections, only performing frequent disinfection cannot achieve desirable epidemic outcomes. Based on our simulation paradigm, we can shed light on better policy designs that achieve a good balance between disease spreading control and social costs.},

Methods: In this paper, we propose an agent-based numerical simulation of pedestrian dynamics in order to assess the behavior of pedestrians in public places in the context of contact transmission of infectious diseases like COVID-19, and to gather insights about exposure times and the overall effectiveness of distancing measures.
Results: To abide by the minimum distance of 1.5 m stipulated by the German government at an infection rate of 2\%, our simulation results suggest that a density of one person per 16 square m or below is sufficient.
Conclusions: The results of this study give insight into how physical distancing as a protective measure can be carried out more efficiently to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.},

  abstract  = {Mathematical modeling of epidemic spreading has been widely adopted to estimate the threats of epidemic diseases (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic) as well as to evaluate epidemic control interventions. The indoor place is considered to be a significant epidemic spreading risk origin, but existing widely-used epidemic spreading models are usually limited for indoor places since the dynamic physical distance changes between people are ignored, and the empirical features of the essential and non-essential travel are not differentiated. In this paper, we introduce a pedestrian-based epidemic spreading model that is capable of modeling indoor transmission risks of diseases during people's social activities. Taking advantage of the before-and-after mobility data from the University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform, it's found that people tend to spend more time in grocery stores once their travel frequencies are restricted to a low level. In other words, an increase in dwell time could balance the decrease in travel frequencies and satisfy people's demands. Based on the pedestrian-based model and the empirical evidence, combined non-pharmaceutical interventions from different operational levels are evaluated. Numerical simulations show that restrictions on people's travel frequency and open hours of indoor places may not be universally effective in reducing average infection risks for each pedestrian who visit the place. Entry limitations can be a widely effective alternative, whereas the decision-maker needs to balance the decrease in risky contacts and the increase in queue length outside the place that may impede people from fulfilling their travel needs. The results show that a good coordination among the decision-makers can contribute to the improvement of the performance of combined non-pharmaceutical interventions, and it also benefits the short-term and long-term interventions in the future.},

It has caused a global outbreak which represents a major threat to global health. Public health resorted to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and lockdown to slow down the spread of the pandemic. However, the effect of each of these measures remains hard to quantify. We design a multi-scale model that simulates the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We describe the motion of individual agents using a social force model. Each agent can be either susceptible, infected, quarantined, immunized or deceased. The model considers both mechanisms of direct and indirect transmission. We parameterize the model to reproduce the early dynamics of disease spread in Italy. We show that panic situations increase the risk of infection transmission in crowds despite social distancing measures. Next, we reveal that pre-symptomatic transmission accelerates the onset of the exponential growth of cases. After that, we demonstrate that the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces determines the number of cases reached during the peak of the epidemic. Then, we show that the restricted movement of the individuals flattens the epidemic curve. Finally, model predictions suggest that measures stricter than social distancing and lockdown were used to control the epidemic in Wuhan, China.},

  abstract     = {Respiratory infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19) have brought huge damages to human society, and the accurate prediction of their transmission trends is essential for both the health system and policymakers. Most related studies focus on epidemic trend forecasting at the macroscopic level, which ignores the microscopic social interactions among individuals. Meanwhile, current microscopic models are still not able to sufficiently decipher the individual-based spreading process and lack valid quantitative tests. To tackle these problems, we propose an exposure-risk-based model at the microscopic level, including 4 modules: individual movement, virion-laden droplet movement, individual exposure risk estimation, and prediction of transmission trends. Firstly, the front two modules reproduce the movements of individuals and the droplets of infectors' expiratory activities, respectively. Then, the outputs are fed to the third module to estimate the personal exposure risk. Finally, the number of new cases is predicted in the final module. By predicting the new COVID- 19 cases in the United States, the performances of our model and 4 other existing macroscopic or microscopic models are compared. Specifically, the mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error provided by the proposed model are respectively 2454.70, 3170.51, and 3.38\% smaller than the minimum results of comparison models. The quantitative results reveal that our model can accurately predict the transmission trends from a microscopic perspective, and it can benefit the further investigation of many microscopic disease transmission factors (e.g., non-walkable areas and facility layouts).},

  abstract     = {Minimizing all aspects of COVID-19 exposure is a high priority as universities prepare to reopen. One of those aspects includes developing protocols for interior spaces such as academic buildings. This paper applies mathematical modeling to investigate different virus exposure levels due to traffic patterns within academic buildings. The assumption used are: 1) Risk of infection is a product of exposure rate and time and 2) the exposure rate decreases with distance. One-way vs. two-way pedestrian traffic scenarios within hallways were modeled and analyzed for various configurations. The underlying assumption that a small exposure to a large number of people is similar to a large exposure to a few people is the driver to minimize exposures levels in all aspects. The analysis indicates that minimizing the time spent in passing between classes is the driving factor in minimizing risk, and one-way traffic may increase the time required to pass between classes. While the case presented is limited, the modeled approaches are intended to provoke future research that can be extended and applied to larger populations to help provide decision makers with more rigorous tools to shape future policies regarding traffic flow within buildings.},

Currently, research groups around the globe are trying to figure out such transmission dynamics under special conditions such as separation policies enforced by governments. Mathematical and computational models, like the compartmental model or the agent-based model, are being used for this purpose. This paper proposes an agent-based model, called INFEKTA, for simulating the transmission of infectious diseases, not only the COVID-19, under social distancing policies. INFEKTA combines the transmission dynamic of a specific disease, (according to parameters found in the literature) with demographic information (population density, age, and genre of individuals) of geopolitical regions of the real town or city under study. Agents (virtual persons) can move, according to its mobility routines and the enforced social distancing policy, on a complex network of accessible places defined over an Euclidean space representing the town or city. The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 under different social distancing policies in Bogota city, the capital of Colombia, is simulated using INFEKTA with one million virtual persons. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of social distancing policies indicates that it is possible to establish a 'medium' (i.e., close 40\% of the places) social distancing policy to achieve a significant reduction in the disease transmission.},

The model is then applied to study the infection transmission within airplanes and the transmission of the Ebola virus through casual contacts. Drastic limitations on air-travel during epidemics, such as during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, carry considerable economic and human costs. We use the computational model to evaluate the effects of passenger movement within airplanes and air-travel policies on the geospatial spread of infectious diseases. We find that boarding policy by an airline is more critical for infection propagation compared to deplaning policy. Enplaning in two sections resulted in fewer infections than the currently followed strategy with multiple zones. In addition, we found that small commercial airplanes are better than larger ones at reducing the number of new infections in a flight. Aggregated results indicate that passenger movement strategies and airplane size predicted through these network models can have significant impact on an event like the 2014 Ebola epidemic. The methodology developed here is generic and can be readily modified to incorporate the impact from the outbreak of other directly transmitted infectious diseases.},

We address this problem through a multiscale model that combines pedestrian dynamics with stochastic infection spread models. The pedestrian dynamics model is utilized to generate the trajectories of motion and contacts between infected and susceptible individuals. We incorporate this information into a stochastic infection dynamics model with infection probability and contact radius as primary inputs. This generic model is applicable for several directly transmitted diseases by varying the input parameters related to infectivity and transmission mechanisms. Through this multiscale framework, we estimate the aggregate numbers and probabilities of newly infected people for different winding queue configurations. We find that the queue configuration has a significant impact on disease spread for a range of infection radii and transmission probabilities. We quantify the effectiveness of wall separators in suppressing the disease spread compared to rope separators. Further, we find that configurations with short aisles lower the infection spread when rope separators are used.},

Within the social force modeling framework, we introduce location dependence on the self-propelling momentum of pedestrian particles. The model parameters are varied over a large design space and the results are compared with experimental observations to validate the model. This model is then used to assess the different approaches to minimize passenger contacts during boarding and deplaning of airplanes. We find that smaller aircrafts are effective in reducing the contacts between passengers. Column wise deplaning and random boarding are found to be two strategies that reduced the number of contacts during passenger movement, and can potentially lower the likelihood of infection spread.},

The chances of contracting COVID-19 in a particular situation depend on the local demographic features, the type of inter-individual interactions, and the compliance with mitigation measures. In this work, we develop a multiscale framework to estimate the individual risk of infection with COVID-19 in different activity areas. The framework is parameterized to describe the motion characteristics of pedestrians in workplaces, schools, shopping centers and other public areas, which makes it suitable to study the risk of infection under specific scenarios. First, we show that exposure to individuals with peak viral loads increases the chances of infection by 99\%. Our simulations suggest that the risk of contracting COVID-19 is especially high in workplaces and residential areas. Next, we determine the age groups that are most susceptible to infection in each location. Then, we show that if 50\% of the population wears face masks, this will reduce the chances of infection by 8\%, 32\%, or 45\%, depending on the type of the used mask. Finally, our simulations suggest that compliance with social distancing reduces the risk of infection by 19\%. Our framework provides a tool that assesses the location-specific risk of infection and helps determine the most effective behavioral measures that protect vulnerable individuals.},

The resulting kinetic model features a variable that denotes the level of exposure to people spreading the disease, a parameter describing the contagion interaction strength, and a kernel function that is a decreasing function of the distance between a person and a spreading individual. Such model is tested on problems involving a small crowd in a square walkable domain.

  abstract  = {COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an over 60 \% reduction in airtravel worldwide according to some estimates. The high economic and public perception costs of potential superspreading during air-travel necessitates research efforts that model, explain and mitigate disease spread. The long-duration exposure to infected passengers and the limited air circulation in the cabin are considered to be responsible for the infection spread during flight. Consequently, recent public health measures are primarily based on these aspects. However, a survey of recent on-flight outbreaks indicates that some aspects of the COVID-19 spread, such as long-distance superspreading, cannot be explained without also considering the movement of people. Another factor that could be influential but has not gained much attention yet is the unpredictable passenger behavior. Here, we use a novel infection risk model that is linked with pedestrian dynamics to accurately capture these aspects of infection spread. The model is parameterized through spatiotemporal analysis of a recent superspreading event in a restaurant in China. The passenger movement during boarding and deplaning, as well as the in-plane movement, are modeled with social force model and agent-based model respectively. We utilize the model to evaluate what-if scenarios on the relative effectiveness of policies and procedures such as masking, social distancing, as well as synergistic effects by combining different approaches in airplanes and other contexts. We find that in certain instances independent strategies can combine synergistically to reduce infection probability, by more than a sum of individual strategies.},

  abstract  = {Background
Despite commercial airlines mandating masks, there have been multiple documented events of COVID-19 superspreading on flights. Conventional models do not adequately explain superspreading patterns on flights, with infection spread wider than expected from proximity based on passenger seating. An important reason for this is that models typically do not consider the movement of passengers during the flight, boarding, or deplaning. Understanding the risks for each of these aspects could provide insight into effective mitigation measures.
Methods
We modeled infection risk from seating and fine-grained movement patterns - boarding, deplaning, and inflight movement. We estimated infection model parameters from a prior superspreading event. We validated the model and the impact of interventions using available data from three flights, including cabin layout and seat locations of infected and uninfected passengers, to suggest interventions to mitigate COVID-19 superspreading events during air travel. Specifically, we studied: 1) London to Hanoi with 201 passengers, including 13 secondary infections among passengers; 2) Singapore to Hangzhou with 321 passengers, including 12 to 14 secondary infections; 3) a non-superspreading event on a private jet in Japan with 9 passengers and no secondary infections.
Results
Our results show that the inclusion of passenger movement better explains the infection spread patterns than conventional models do. We also found that FFP2/N95 mask usage would have reduced infection by 95-100\%, while cloth masks would have reduced it by only 40-80\%. Results indicate that leaving the middle seat vacant is effective in reducing infection, and the effectiveness increases when combined with good quality masks. However, with a good mask, the risk is quite low even without the middle seats being empty.
Conclusions
Our results suggest the need for more stringent guidelines to reduce aviation-related superspreading events of COVID-19.},

  abstract     = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to develop a first-principles model for the simulation of pedestrian flows and crowd dynamics capable of computing the movement of a million pedestrians in real-time in order to assess the potential safety hazards and operational performance at events where many individuals are gathered. Examples of such situations are sport and music events, cinemas and theatres, museums, conference centres, places of pilgrimage and worship, street demonstrations, emergency evacuation during natural disasters.

Design/methodology/approach
The model is based on a series of forces, such as: will forces (the desire to reach a place at a certain time), pedestrian collision avoidance forces, obstacle/wall avoidance forces; pedestrian contact forces, and obstacle/wall contact forces. In order to allow for general geometries a so-called background triangulation is used to carry all geographic information. At any given time the location of any given pedestrian is updated on this mesh. The model has been validated qualitatively and quantitavely on repeated occasions. The code has been ported to shared and distributed memory parallel machines.

Findings
The results obtained show that the stated aim of computing the movement of a million pedestrians in real-time has been achieved. This is an important milestone, as it enables faster-than-real-time simulations of large crowds (stadiums, airports, train and bus stations, concerts) as well as evacuation simulations for whole cities.

Research limitations/implications
All models are wrong, but some are useful. The same applies to any modelling of pedestrians. Pedestrians are not machines, so stochastic runs will be required in the future in order to obtain statistically relevant ensembles.

Practical implications
This opens the way to link real-time data gathering of crowds (i.e. via cameras) with predictive calculations done faster than real-time, so that security personnel can be alerted to potential future problems during large-scale events.

Social implications
This will allow much better predictions for large-scale events, improving security and comfort.

Originality/value
This is the first time such speeds have been achieved for a micro-modelling code for pedestrians.},

Bottlenecks are of particular interest for applications such as crowd management and design of emergency routes because they limit the performance of a facility. In addition to previous work on the dynamics within the bottleneck, this study focuses on the dynamics in front of the bottleneck, more specifically, at entrances. The experimental set-up simulates an entrance scenario to a concert consisting of an entrance gate (serving as bottleneck) and a corridor formed by barriers. The parameters examined are the corridor width, degree of motivation and priming of the social norm of queuing. The analysis is based on head trajectories and questionnaires. We show that the density of persons per square metre depends on motivation and also increases continuously with increasing corridor width, meaning that a density reduction can be achieved by a reduction of space. In comparison to other corridor widths observed, the narrowest corridor is rated as being fairer, more comfortable and as showing less unfair behaviour. Pushing behaviour is seen as ambivalent: it is rated as unfair and listed as a strategy for faster access.},

Here we describe the methodology of Covasim (COVID-19 Agent-based Simulator), an open-source model developed to help address these questions. Covasim includes country-specific demographic information on age structure and population size; realistic transmission networks in different social layers, including households, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, and communities; age-specific disease outcomes; and intrahost viral dynamics, including viral-load-based transmissibility. Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing and protective equipment; pharmaceutical interventions, including vaccination; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine. These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors. Implemented in pure Python, Covasim has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, ease of use, and flexibility: realistic and highly customized scenarios can be run on a standard laptop in under a minute. In collaboration with local health agencies and policymakers, Covasim has already been applied to examine epidemic dynamics and inform policy decisions in more than a dozen countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America.},

  abstract  = {The global pandemic caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) disease has collapsed the worldwide economy. Elements such as non-obligatory vaccination, new strain variants and lack of discipline to follow social distancing measures suggest the possibility that COVID-19 may continue to exist, exhibiting the behavior of a seasonal disease. As the socio-economic crisis has become unsustainable, all countries are planning strategies to gradually restart their economic and social activities. Initially, several containment measures have been adopted involving social distancing, infection detection tests, and ventilation systems. Despite the implementation of such policies, there exists a lack of evaluation of their performance to reduce the contagion index. This means there are no appropriate indicators to decide which intervention or set of interventions present the most effective result. Under these conditions, the development of models that provide useful information in the design and evaluation of containment measures and re-opening policies is of prime concern. In this paper, a novel approach to model the transmission process of COVID-19 in closed environments is proposed. The proposed model can simulate the effects that result from the complex interaction among individuals when they follow a particular containment measure or re-opening policy. With the proposed model, different hypothetical re-opening policies, that are otherwise impossible to analyze in real conditions, can be tested. Computer experiments demonstrate that the proposed model provides suitable information and realistic predictions, which are appropriate for designing strategies that allow a safe return to economic activities.},

We proposed a novel multi-agent model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 by considering several influencing factors. The model divides the population into susceptible and infected and analyzes the impact of different prevention and control measures, such as limiting the number of people and wearing masks on the spread of COVID-19. The findings suggest that reducing population density and wearing masks can significantly reduce the likelihood of virus transmission. Specifically, the research shows that if the population moves within a fixed range, almost everyone will eventually be infected within 1 h. When the population density is 50 percent, the infection rate is as high as 96 percent. If everyone does not wear a mask, nearly 72.33 percent of the people will be infected after 1 h. However, when people wear masks, the infection rate is consistently lower than when they do not wear masks. Even if only 25 percent of people wear masks, the infection rate with masks is 27.67 percent lower than without masks, which is strong evidence of the importance of wearing a mask. As people's daily activities are mostly carried out indoors, and many super-spreading events of the new crown epidemic also originated from indoor gatherings, the research on indoor epidemic prevention and control is essential. This study provides decision-making support for epidemic preventions and controls and the proposed methodology can be used in other regions and future epidemics.},

  title    = {Stochastic fluctuations of diluted pedestrian dynamics along curved paths},
  abstract = {As we walk towards our destinations, our trajectories are constantly influenced by the presence of obstacles and infrastructural elements: even in absence of crowding our paths are often curved. Over the last two decades pedestrian dynamics have been extensively studied aiming at quantitative models with both fundamental and technological relevance. Walking kinematics along straight paths have been experimentally investigated and quantitatively modeled in the diluted limit (i.e. in absence of pedestrian-pedestrian interactions). It is natural to expect that models for straight paths may be an accurate approximations of the dynamics even for paths with curvature radii much larger than the size of a single person. Conversely, as paths curvature increase one may expect larger and larger deviations. As no clear experimental consensus has been reached yet in the literature, here we accurately and systematically investigate the effect of paths curvature on diluted pedestrian dynamics. Thanks to a extensive and highly accurate set of real-life measurements campaign, we derive and validate via a Langevin-like social-force model capable of quantitatively describing both averages and fluctuations. Leveraging on the differential geometric notion of covariant derivative, we generalize previous work by some of the authors, effectively casting a Langevin social-force model for the straight walking dynamics in a curved geometric setting. We deem this the necessary first step to understand and model the more general and ubiquitous case of pedestrians following curved paths in the presence of crowd traffic.},

In this paper, we develop a novel data-driven method-anti-circulant dynamic mode decomposition with sparsity-promoting (circDMDsp)- to study the dynamics of highway traffic speed data.
Particularly, circDMDsp addresses several issues that hinder the application of existing DMD models: limited spatial dimension, presence of both recurrent and non-recurrent patterns, high level of noise, and known mode stability. The proposed circDMDsp framework allows us to numerically extract spatial-temporal coherent structures with physical meanings, interpretations: the dynamic modes reflect coherent spatial bases, and the corresponding temporal patterns capture the temporal oscillation, evolution of these dynamic modes. Our result based on Seattle highway loop detector data showcases that traffic speed data is governed by a set of periodic components, e.g., mean pattern, daily pattern, and weekly pattern, and each of them has a unique spatial structure. The spatiotemporal patterns can also be used to recover, denoise observed data and predict future values at any timestamp by extrapolating the temporal Vandermonde matrix. Our experiments also demonstrate that the proposed circDMDsp framework is more accurate and robust in data reconstruction and prediction than other DMD-based models. The code for the algorithm and experiment is available at https://github.com/mcgill-smart-transport/circDMDsp.},

  doi      = {10.48550/arXiv.2307.15609},
  abstract = {Staircases play an essential role in crowd dynamics, allowing pedestrians to flow across large multi-level public facilities such as transportation hubs, and office buildings. Achieving a robust understanding of pedestrian behavior in these facilities is a key societal necessity. What makes this an outstanding scientific challenge is the extreme randomness intrinsic to pedestrian behavior. Any quantitative understanding necessarily needs to be probabilistic, including average dynamics and fluctuations. In this work, we analyze data from an unprecedentedly high statistics year-long pedestrian tracking campaign, in which we anonymously collected millions of trajectories across a staircase within Eindhoven train station (NL). Made possible thanks to a state-of-the-art, faster than real-time, computer vision approach hinged on 3D depth imaging, and YOLOv7-based depth localization. We consider both free-stream conditions, i.e. pedestrians walking in undisturbed, and trafficked conditions, uni/bidirectional flows. We report the position vs density, considering the crowd as a 'compressible' physical medium. We show how pedestrians willingly opt to occupy fewer space than available, accepting a certain degree of compressibility. This is a non-trivial physical feature of pedestrian dynamics and we introduce a novel way to quantify this effect. As density increases, pedestrians strive to keep a minimum distance d = 0.6 m from the person in front of them. Finally, we establish first-of-kind fully resolved probabilistic fundamental diagrams, where we model the pedestrian walking velocity as a mixture of a slow and fast-paced component. Notably, averages and modes of velocity distribution turn out to be substantially different. Our results, including probabilistic parametrizations based on few variables, are key towards improved facility design and realistic simulation of pedestrians on staircases.},

  abstract = {Predicting human trajectories is a challenging task due to the complexity of pedestrian behavior, which is influenced by external factors such as the
scene's topology and interactions with other pedestrians.
A special challenge
arises from the dependence of the behaviour on the density of the scene.
In the literature, deep learning algorithms show the best performance in
predicting pedestrian trajectories, but so far just for situations with low den-
sities. In this study, we aim to investigate the suitability of these algorithms
for high-density scenarios by evaluating them on different error metrics and
comparing their accuracy to that of knowledge-based models that have been
used since long time in the literature.
The findings indicate that deep learning
algorithms provide improved trajectory prediction accuracy in the distance
metrics for all tested densities. Nevertheless, we observe a significant number of collisions in the predictions, especially in high-density scenarios. This
issue arises partly due to the absence of a collision avoidance mechanism within the algorithms and partly because the distance-based collision metric
is inadequate for dense situations. To address these limitations, we propose the introduction of a novel continuous collision metric based on pedestrians'
time-to-collision. Subsequently, we outline how this metric can be utilized to
enhance the training of the algorithms.},

  abstract  = {During infectious disease outbreaks, some infected individuals may spread the disease widely and amplify risks in the community. People whose daily activities bring them in close proximity to many others can unknowingly become superspreaders. The use of contact tracking based on social networks, GPS, or mobile tracking data can help to identify superspreaders and break the chain of transmission. We propose a model that aims at providing insight into risk factors of superspreading events. Here, we use a social force model to estimate the superspreading potential of individuals walking in a bidirectional corridor. First, we applied the model to identify parameters that favor exposure to an infectious person in scattered crowds. We find that low walking speed and high body mass both increase the expected number of close exposures. Panic events exacerbate the risks while social distancing reduces both the number and duration of close encounters. Further, in dense crowds, pedestrians interact more and cannot easily maintain the social distance between them. The number of exposures increases with the density of person in the corridor. The study of movements reveals that individuals walking toward the center of the corridor tend to rotate and zigzag more than those walking along the edges, and thus have higher risks of superspreading. The corridor model can be applied to designing risk reduction measures for specific high volume venues, including transit stations, stadiums, and schools.},

  comment   = {<note author="sr">The authors do not state how they measure the number of contacts. Is it A) the number of agent overlaps, B) The number of times an agent is in close proximity to another agent, or C) a proximity for a given time, or any other metric? Are contacts with the same pair of agents counted only once or multiple times? Irrespective of this lack of information, the analyzed scenario is ridiculous. Speaking of a super spreadingevent in a counter flow sceanrio with only direct transmission (no airborne transmission) is quite unrealistic for any disease. Furthermore, the SFM is clearly not suitable for such an analysis. It is common sense that this locomotion model is not capable of avoiding collisions, it rather leads to oscillations with agents coming close to each other again and again. Using a metric such as A) or B) would lead to overestimates.</note>},

  abstract = {On the basis of data-driven methodology, especially velocity correlations of pedestrians moving in a crowd, we have proposed a new model of pedestrian dynamics with an easy-adjustable space discretization.
The model is based on Cellular Automata (CA) with an adaptive lattice and takes into account proxemics patterns among pedestrians.
The proposed model uses agents located on the CA lattice, constructed using the concept of Floor Field (FF), namely, a set of gradient potential fields influencing the movement of agents.
In the model, we have proposed three kinds of such fields: Static FF-responsible for navigation to agents' Points of Interest (POIs), Wall FF-a repulsive influence with obstacles, and Interplay FF-to model agents' volume and proxemics effects.
The third field, which models mutual relations between pedestrians taking into account the rules of proxemics is an added value in the area of crowd modeling and simulation. During the creation of the proposed model, we have based on a set of experimental data provided by J\"ulich Supercomputing Centre and our previous analysis of spatial patterns and velocity correlations.
Thus, the proposed model includes, among other things the most probable positions of the nearest neighbors in a crowd-including the shape of "the forbidden zone" around a pedestrian and the finding of rules explaining observed mutual spatial relations between neighbors in a crowd. In the described model the cell size is an adjustable parameter, with available values from 1 cm to 50 cm. It is possible with the usage of embodied agents which always occupy only one cell of Cellular Automata, actual pedestrian volume is modeled with the Interplay FF. An interesting property of the model is that changing the cell size does not involve changing the rules of the model, e.g. its transition function.},
  comment  = {GK: CA model where the shape of pedestrian potential field is modeled on the basis of data from J\"ulich. Apparently there is less of a need for space to the sides than at the front (or back). So the potential should be more elliptical. 
Only one-directional flow. Cell size in CA can be as small as 1cm. Navigation is on floor-fields.},

  abstract  = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic markedly changed human mobility patterns, necessitating epidemiological models that can capture the effects of these changes in mobility on the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we introduce a metapopulation susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model that integrates fine-grained, dynamic mobility networks to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in ten of the largest US metropolitan areas. Our mobility networks are derived from mobile phone data and map the hourly movements of 98 million people from neighbourhoods (or census block groups) to points of interest such as restaurants and religious establishments, connecting 56,945 census block groups to 552,758 points of interest with 5.4 billion hourly edges. We show that by integrating these networks, a relatively simple SEIR model can accurately fit the real case trajectory, despite substantial changes in the behaviour of the population over time. Our model predicts that a small minority of 'superspreader' points of interest account for a large majority of the infections, and that restricting the maximum occupancy at each point of interest is more effective than uniformly reducing mobility. Our model also correctly predicts higher infection rates among disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups solely as the result of differences in mobility: we find that disadvantaged groups have not been able to reduce their mobility as sharply, and that the points of interest that they visit are more crowded and are therefore associated with higher risk. By capturing who is infected at which locations, our model supports detailed analyses that can inform more-effective and equitable policy responses to COVID-19.},

They concluded that the travel quarantine introduced in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 only delayed epidemic progression by 3 to 5 days within China, but international travel restrictions did help to slow spread elsewhere in the world until mid-February. Their results suggest that early detection, hand washing, self-isolation, and household quarantine will likely be more effective than travel restrictions at mitigating this pandemic.},

Thereafter, the motion of pedestrians, as well as proper ways to couple computational fluid dynamics and computational crowd dynamics to enable high-fidelity pathogen transmission and infection simulations is treated. The present review shows that high-fidelity simulations of pathogen propagation, transmission and mitigation in the built environment have reached a high degree of sophistication, offering a quantum leap in accuracy from simpler probabilistic models.

  abstract     = {The global Covid-19 pandemic has raised many questions about how we occupy and move in the built environment. Interior environments have been increasingly discussed in numerous studies highlighting how interior spaces play a key role in the spread of pandemics. One societal challenge is to find short-term strategies to reopen indoor venues. Most current approaches focus on an individual's behavior (maintaining social distance, wearing face masks, and washing their hands) and government policies (confinement, curfew, quarantine, etc.). However, few studies have been conducted to understand a building's interior where most transmission takes place. How will the utilization of existing interior spaces be improved above and beyond universally applied criteria, while minimizing the risk of disease transmission? This article presents an agent-based model that examines disease transmission risks in various 'interior types' in combination with user behaviors and their mobility, as well as three types of transmission vectors (direct, airborne and via surfaces). The model also integrates numerous policy interventions, including wearing masks, hand washing, and the possibility of easily modifying the organization of spaces. Different studies at various scales were conducted both on the University of Guadalajara (UdeG) campus as well as at the MIT Media Lab to illustrate the application of this model.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents an integrated computational modelling framework combining pedestrian dynamics and infection spread models, to analyse the infectious disease spread during the different stages of air-travel. While, commercial air travel is central to the global mobility of goods and people, it has also been identified as a leading factor in the spread of several epidemic diseases including influenza, SARS and Ebola. The mixing of susceptible and infectious individuals in these high people density locations like airports involves pedestrian movement which needs to be taken into account in the modelling studies of disease dynamics. We develop a Molecular Dynamics based social force modeling approach for pedestrian dynamics and combine it with a stochastic infection dynamics model to evaluate the spread of viral infectious diseases in airplanes and airports. We apply the multiscale model for various key components of air travel and suggest strategies to reduce the number of contacts and the spread of infectious diseases. We simulate pedestrian movement during boarding and deplaning of some typical commercial airplane models and movement of people through security check areas. We found specific boarding strategies that reduce the number of contacts. Further, we find that smaller airplanes are more effective in reducing the number of contacts compared to larger airplanes. We propose certain queue configuration that reduces contacts between people and mitigate disease spread.},

  abstract  = {The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has imposed the need for a series of social distancing restrictions worldwide to mitigate the scourge of the COVID-19 pandemic. This applies to many domains, including airplane boarding and seat assignments. As airlines are considering their passengers' safety during the pandemic, boarding methods should be evaluated both in terms of social distancing norms and the resulting efficiency for the airlines. The present paper analyzes the impact of a series of restrictions that have been imposed or mooted worldwide on the boarding methods used by the airlines, featuring the use of jet-bridges and one-door boarding. To compare the efficacy of classical airplane boarding methods with respect to new social distancing norms, five metrics were used to evaluate their performance. One metric is the time to complete the boarding of the airplane. The other four metrics concern passenger health and reflect the potential exposure to the virus from other passengers through the air and surfaces (e.g., headrests and luggage) touched by passengers. We use the simulation platform in NetLogo to test six common boarding methods under various conditions. The back-to-front by row boarding method results in the longest time to complete boarding but has the advantage of providing the lowest health risk for two metrics. Those two metrics are based on passengers potentially infecting those passengers previously seated in the rows they traverse. Interestingly, those two risks are reduced for most boarding methods when the social distance between adjacent passengers advancing down the aisle is increased, thus indicating an unanticipated benefit stemming from this form of social distancing. The modified reverse pyramid by half zone method provides the shortest time to the completing boarding of the airplane and-along with the WilMA boarding method-provides the lowest health risk stemming from potential infection resulting from seat interferences. Airlines have the difficult task of making tradeoffs between economic productivity and the resulting impact on various health risks},

  abstract  = {Airlines have recently instituted practices to reduce the risk of their passengers becoming infected with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Some airlines block their airplanes' middle seats to preserve social distancing among seated passengers. In this context, we present six new boarding methods and compare their performance with that of the two best boarding methods used to date with social distancing. We evaluate the eight boarding methods using three performance metrics related to passenger health and one operational metric (airplane boarding time) for a one-door airplane. The three health metrics reflect the risks of virus spread by passengers through the air and surfaces (e.g. headrests and seat arms) and consider the amount of aisle social distancing between adjacent boarding passengers walking towards their seats. For an airline that highly values the avoidance of window seat risk, the best method to use is one of the new methods: back-to-front by row - WilMA, though it will result in a longer time to complete boarding of the airplane. Airlines placing greater emphasis on fast boarding times- while still providing favorable values for the health metrics-will be best served by using new methods back-to-front by row - WilMA - offset 2 and - offset 3 when aisle social distancing is 1 m and 2 m respectively.},

  abstract  = {Social distancing reduces the risk of people becoming infected with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). When passengers are transported from an airport terminal to an airplane using apron buses, safe social distancing during pandemic times reduces the capacity of the apron buses and has led to the practice of airlines keeping the middle seats of the airplanes unoccupied. This article adapts classical boarding methods so that they may be used with social distancing and apron buses. We conduct stochastic simulation experiments to assess nine adaptations of boarding methods according to four performance metrics. Three of the metrics are related to the risk of the virus spreading to passengers during boarding. The fourth metric is the time to complete boarding of the two-door airplane when apron bus transport passengers to the airplane. Our experiments assume that passengers advancing to their airplane seats are separated by an aisle social distance of 1 m or 2 m. Numerical results indicate that the three variations (adaptations) of the Reverse pyramid method are the best candidates for airlines to consider in this socially distanced context. The particular adaptation to use depends on an airline's relative preference for having short boarding times versus a reduced risk of later boarding passengers passing (and thereby possibly infecting) previously seated window seat passengers. If an airline considers the latter risk to be unimportant, then the Reverse pyramid - Spread method would be the best choice because it provides the fastest time to board the airplane and is tied for the best values for the other two health risk measures.},

  abstract  = {Social distancing resulting from the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has disrupted the airplane boarding process. Social distancing norms reduce airplane capacity by keeping the middle seats unoccupied, while an imposed aisle social distance between boarding passengers slows the boarding. Recent literature suggests the Reverse Pyramid boarding method is a promising way to reduce health risk and keep boarding times low when 10 apron buses (essentially 10 boarding groups) are used to transport passengers from the airport terminal to a two-door airplane. We adapt the Reverse Pyramid method for social distancing when an airplane is boarded using a jet bridge that connects the terminal the airplane's front door. We vary the number of boarding groups from two to six and use stochastic simulation and agent-based modelling to show the resulting impact on four performance evaluation metrics. Increasing the number of boarding groups from two to six reduces boarding time only up to four groups but continues to reduce infection risk up to six groups. If the passengers carry fewer luggage aboard the airplane, health risks (as well as boarding times) decrease. One adaptation of the Reverse Pyramid (RP) method (RP-Spread) provides slightly faster boarding times than the other (RP-Steep), when luggage volumes are high, while RP-Steep results in less risk to window seat passengers from later-boarding passengers walking by their row. Increasing the minimum aisle social distance from 1 m to 2 m increases boarding times but results in lower health risks to passengers walking down the aisle and to the previously seated passengers they pass.},

We focus on a medium size population (up to 1000 people) with a small number of infectious people (1 or 2) and the rest of the people are divided between immune and susceptible. We adopt a space-continuous model that represents pedestrian dynamics by the forces acting on them, i.e. a microscopic force-based model. Once discretized, the model results in a high-dimensional system of second order ordinary differential equations. Before adding the contact tracking to the pedestrian dynamics model, we calibrate the model parameters, compare the model results against empirical data, and show that pedestrian self-organization into lanes can be captured. We consider an explicit approach for contact tracking by introducing a sickness domain around a sick person. A healthy but susceptible person who remains in the sickness domain for a certain amount of time may get infected (with a prescribed probability) and become a so-called secondary contact. As a concrete setting to simulate the onset of disease spreading, we consider terminals in two US airports: Hobby Airport in Houston and the Atlanta International Airport. We consider different scenarios and we quantify the increase in average number of secondary contacts as a given terminal becomes more densely populated, the percentage of immune people decreases, the number of primary contacts increases, and areas of high density (such as the boarding buses) are present.},

We conducted a field study and performed extensive numerical simulations of infection transmission in a fever clinic during pandemic through an agent-based model with pedestrian dynamic and an infection transmission model. Furthermore, we evaluated the cross-infection risk of the patients influenced by the patient inject flow, medical service capability and plane layout. The service capability of fever clinic is determined by the least efficient medical session. When patient inject flow exceeded the service capability, the average dwell time, contact time, exposure dose, and risk of infection of patients all increased dramatically. With the patient inject flow exceeding the service capability, the growth rate of the contact time between patients and the cross-infection risk increased by 11.5-fold and 29.5-fold, respectively. The plane layout of the fever clinic affected the exposure dose and risk of infection. The waiting areas in the fever clinic had the highest risk, where the cumulative exposure dose of virus occupied up to 66.5 percent of the total. Our research will help to evaluate the biosafety of hospital buildings used for the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases.},

  abstract  = {The transmission of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 is exacerbated in densely populated urban areas and crowded indoor settings. Despite the majority of transmissions occurring in such settings, controlling viral spread through individual-level contacts indoors remains challenging. Experimental studies have investigated the transmission patterns of respiratory behaviors such as coughing or sneezing in controlled spatial environments. However, the effects of dynamic movement and spatial structures have been ignored, making it difficult to apply findings to urban policy and planning. To address this gap, we developed agent-based simulations to investigate individual virus inhalation patterns across multiple scenarios in a symmetrical and formulaic indoor space. We conducted sensitivity analysis using regression emulator models to identify significant factors for viral transmission. Our results indicate positive associations with viral transmission in descending order of: (1) stay time; (2) encounter frequency; and (3) initial infected population; while negative associations are: (4) mask wearing; (5) distance to infected people; (6) nearest infected people's mask wearing; and (7) distance to entrance. We also found that narrow passages between obstacles increase virus transmission from breathing. Furthermore, we conducted a case study to investigate the potential of reducing the amount of individually inhaled virus by controlling behaviors and spatial environments. Our findings suggest that mask wearing and reduced stay time can substantially reduce transmission risk, while a large number of contacts and high grouping time result in the growth of the infected population at a certain threshold. These results provide guidance for decision makers to formulate guidelines for curbing the spread of respiratory diseases in indoor spaces.},

Given this context, this study developed an interactive agent-based modelling framework embedded with a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model for assessing COVID-19 transmission risk on construction sites, with the application of five safety control measures (i.e., SCM including face covering, vaccination, ventilation, social distance and isolation). This study afterwards set up 108 SCM scenarios based on the five SCM and sensitivity analyses were conducted in order to generate robust results. Based on the simulation results, the efficacy of the 5 SCM in preventing COVID-19 spread was assessed. Therefore, the results of the 108 scenarios are a useful scientific reference for stakeholders or policymakers when making decisions regarding mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases within the construction sector.},

  abstract  = {University buildings are one of the most relevant closed environments in which the COVID-19 event clearly pointed out stakeholders' needs toward safety issues, especially because of the possibility of day-to-day presences of the same users (i.e. students, teachers) and overcrowding causing long-lasting contacts with possible "infectors". While waiting for the vaccine, as for other public buildings, policy-makers' measures to limit virus outbreaks combine individual's strategies (facial masks), occupants' capacity and access control. But, up to now, no easy-to-apply tools are available for assessing the punctual effectiveness of such measures. To fill this gap, this work proposes a quick and probabilistic simulation model based on consolidated proximity and exposure-time-based rules for virus transmission confirmed by international health organizations. The building occupancy is defined according to university scheduling, identifying the main "attraction areas" in the building (classrooms, break-areas). Scenarios are defined in terms of occupants' densities and the above-mentioned mitigation strategies. The model is calibrated on experimental data and applied to a relevant university building. Results demonstrate the model capabilities. In particular, it underlines that if such strategies are not combined, the virus spreading can be limited by only using high protection respiratory devices (i.e. FFP3) by almost every occupant. On the contrary, the combination between access control and building capacity limitation can lead to the adoption of lighter protective devices (i.e. surgical masks), thus improving the feasibility, users' comfort and favorable reception. Simplified rules to combine acceptable mask filters-occupants' density are thus provided to help stakeholders in organizing users' presences in the building during the pandemic.},

  abstract  = {Touristic cities will suffer from COVID-19 emergency because of its economic impact on their communities. The first emergency phases involved a wide closure of such areas to support "social distancing" measures (i.e. travels limitation; lockdown of (over)crowd-prone activities). In the "second phase", individual's risk-mitigation strategies (facial masks) could be properly linked to "social distancing" to ensure re-opening touristic cities to visitors. Simulation tools could support the effectiveness evaluation of risk-mitigation measures to look for an economic and social optimum for activities restarting. This work modifies an existing Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in touristic areas, including tourists and residents' behaviours, movement and virus effects on them according to a probabilistic approach. Consolidated proximity-based and exposure-time-based contagion spreading rules are included according to international health organizations and previous calibration through experimental data. Effects of tourists' capacity (as "social distancing"-based measure) and other strategies (i.e. facial mask implementation) are evaluated depending on virus-related conditions (i.e. initial infector percentages). An idealized scenario representing a significant case study has been analysed to demonstrate the tool capabilities and compare the effectiveness of those solutions. Results show that "social distancing" seems to be more effective at the highest infectors' rates, although represents an extreme measure with important economic effects. This measure loses its full effectiveness (on the community) as the infectors' rate decreases and individuals' protection measures become predominant (facial masks). The model could be integrated to consider other recurring issues on tourist-related fruition and schedule of urban spaces and facilities (e.g. cultural/leisure buildings).},

  note      = {submitted to Safety Science},
  abstract  = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put forth the integration of pathogen transmission into microscopic crowd models to simulate the exposure risk for individuals. However, it is crucial to account for uncertainties in the model input as long as we lack data, particularly regarding airborne transmission of the coronavirus. In this study, we quantify uncertainties in such simulations to increase their reliability and informative value. The underlying model considers airborne virus transmission in several everyday situations. The locomotion layer of the model captures crowd management strategies, while its transmission layer returns the virtual persons' exposures to pathogens. We conduct a global sensitivity analysis to rank uncertain parameters according to their impact on the exposure risk and employ forward propagation techniques to quantify the output uncertainty. The sensitivity analysis reveals that two model parameters related to the extent and spread of aerosols are essential, whereas a parameter describing the decay of pathogens is barely influential. The forward propagation demonstrates how crowd management alleviates the exposure risk in the analyzed situations. Moreover, we identify aerosol spread as a dominant aspect on which research should focus.},

  abstract     = {Chemical terrorist attacks in closed areas are a serious threat to national security. In order to deduct the best reponse with regard to treatment and protective measures, simulation is the best tool, either in-silico or as a real-life exercise. The difficulty of the latter is the great number of resources necessary to set up a large-scale realistic exercise while the limitation of the former is that the model needs to be as realistic as possible to draw relevant conclusions. The complexity in designing and running a realistic and large-scale computer simulation model with pedestrian movement and air/gas flows renders studies near-impossible with current computers. To address the complexity issue, agent-based simulation is usually preferred over a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach. The aim of this contribution is to present a method to generate a list of victims with both inhaled doses of the chemical warfare agent sarin (NATO designation GB) and traumatic injuries in an emergency subway evacuation scenario. The method couples a simple gas diffusion model with a crowd dynamics model. The interaction of the crowd follows a social force model (SFM) where the overlaps are used to determine a physical injury distribution.},

  abstract  = {SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have occurred on several nautical vessels, driven by the high-density contact networks on these ships. Optimal strategies for prevention and control that account for realistic contact networks are needed. We developed a network-based transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 on the Diamond Princess outbreak to characterize transmission dynamics and to estimate the epidemiological impact of outbreak control and prevention measures. This model represented the dynamic multi-layer network structure of passenger-passenger, passenger-crew, and crew-crew contacts, both before and after the large-scale network lockdown imposed on the ship in response to the disease outbreak. Model scenarios evaluated variations in the timing of the network lockdown, reduction in contact intensity within the sub-networks, and diagnosis-based case isolation on outbreak prevention. We found that only extreme restrictions in contact patterns during network lockdown and idealistic clinical response scenarios could avert a major COVID-19 outbreak. Contact network changes associated with adequate outbreak prevention were the restriction of passengers to their cabins, with limited passenger-crew contacts. Clinical response strategies required for outbreak prevention may be infeasible in many cruise settings: early mass screening with an ideal PCR test (100 percent sensitivity) and immediate case isolation upon diagnosis. Personal protective equipment (e.g., facemasks) had limited impact in this environment because the majority of transmissions after the ship lockdown occurred between passengers in cabins where masks were not consistently used. Public health restrictions on optional leisure activities like these should be considered until longer-term effective solutions such as a COVID-19 vaccine become widely available.},

  abstract  = {The Covid-19 pandemic has had a large impact on the world. The virus spreads especially easily among people in indoor spaces such as restaurants. Hence, tools that can assess how different restaurant settings can impact the potential spread of an airborne virus and that can assess the effectiveness of mitigation policies are of high value. Microscopic pedestrian models provide the tools necessary to assess the detailed movements of people in a restaurant and with that the risk of virus transmission. This paper presents the application of a microscopic pedestrian model, including a novel activity choice and scheduling model, to assess virus transmission risks in restaurants. Simulation experiments identify that different factors impact virus transmission risks in a restaurant. Contacts between restaurant staff and customers are the driving factor for virus transmission in a restaurant whereby especially staff presents a big risk. Hence, mitigation policies focussing on these interactions and on preventing staff from transmitting the virus can be highly effective. The results also show that different restaurant layouts and setups lead to distinctly different transmission risks. Therefore, insights obtained from simulating one restaurant cannot be just transferred to any other restaurant. Together, these results show the added value of including pedestrian models in disease transmission risk modelling exercises to mitigate the impact of a pandemic caused by an airborne virus. However, the research also shows that, to better utilize the potential of pedestrian models for disease transmission risk modelling, future research of pedestrian activity scheduling behaviour in indoor spaces is necessary.},

As such naturally much discussion and criticism have spawned around it, some of which concerns the existence of oscillations in the movement of pedestrians. This contribution is investigating under which circumstances, parameter choices, and model variants oscillations do occur and how this can be prevented. It is shown that oscillations can be excluded if the model parameters fulfill certain relations. The fact that with some parameter choices oscillations occur and with some not is exploited to verify a specific computer implementation of the model.},

However, existing research lacks a comprehensive analysis of HBiF knowledge from both perspectives. To address this issue, we examined nearly 1900 HBiF-related research papers and their references, identifying around 6600 frequently cited references as the HBiF knowledge foundation. We focused on highly prominent items using metrics like citation frequency, burst, and centrality. By analysing co-citation patterns among these references, we unveiled current trends and waning areas of HBiF research. This study identifies knowledge gaps and potential future directions for the field, enabling both mapping of the research concerning our fundamental understanding of behavioural decision-making in fires as well as developing more effective life-saving strategies.},

Ensuring pedestrian safety in bottleneck areas is of utmost importance, and understanding flow characteristics is essential to improving resilience levels. In this study, a comparative experiment was conducted to investigate crowd dynamics in different transition bottleneck types, including straight, right-angle, and curve transitions. Pedestrian flow data were analyzed to examine the impact of transition shape on pedestrian characteristics, such as passing time, speeds, trajectories, and densities within the bottleneck. The results indicate that the curve bottleneck outperforms the other two types, significantly improving traffic capacity, particularly when the pedestrian rate ranges from 0.5 to 1.25 person/s. The curve bottleneck demonstrates the minimum passing time, lowest density, and fastest passing speed. Moreover, under various flow rates, the cumulative maximum pedestrian density of curve bottlenecks is consistently smaller than the other types. These findings offer valuable insights for designing and managing pedestrian flow in bottleneck areas to ensure safety and resilience levels.},

Monitoring and controlling pedestrian dynamics can prevent dangerous situations from occurring. However, little is known about the specific factors that contribute to harmful situations. For example, the individual response of a person to external forces in dense crowds is not well studied. In order to address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a series of experiments to examine how a push propagates through a row of people and how it affects the participants. We recorded 2D head trajectories and 3D motion capturing data. To ensure that different trials can be compared to one another, we measured the force at the impact. We find that that the propagation distance as well as the propagation speed of the push are mainly functions of the strength of the push and in particular the latter depends on the initial arm posture of the pushed participants. Our results can contribute to a deeper understanding of the microscopic causes of macroscopic phenomena in large groups, and can be applied to inform models of pedestrian dynamics or validate them, ultimately improving crowd safety.},

  abstract = {Crowd simulation holds crucial applications in various domains, such as urban planning, architectural design, and traffic arrangement. In recent years, physics-informed machine learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in crowd simulation but fail to model the heterogeneity and multi-modality of human movement comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a social physics-informed diffusion model named SPDiff to mitigate the above gap. SPDiff takes both the interactive and historical information of crowds in the current timeframe to reverse the diffusion process, thereby generating the distribution of pedestrian movement in the subsequent timeframe. Inspired by the well-known social physics model, i.e., Social Force, regarding crowd dynamics, we design a crowd interaction module to guide the denoising process and further enhance this module with the equivariant properties of crowd interactions. To mitigate error accumulation in long-term simulations, we propose a multi-frame rollout training algorithm for diffusion modeling. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPDiff in terms of macroscopic and microscopic evaluation metrics. Code and appendix are available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/SPDiff.},

  abstract     = {Current statistical models to simulate pandemics miss the most relevant information about the close atomic interactions between individuals which is the key aspect of virus spread. Thus, they lack a proper visualization of such interactions and their impact on virus spread. In the field of computer graphics, and more specifically in computer animation, there have been many crowd simulation models to populate virtual environments. However, the focus has typically been to simulate reasonable paths between random or semi-random locations in a map, without any possibility of analyzing specific individual behavior. We propose a crowd simulation framework to accurately simulate the interactions in a city environment at the individual level, with the purpose of recording and analyzing the spread of human diseases. By simulating the whereabouts of agents throughout the day by mimicking the actual activities of a population in their daily routines, we can accurately predict the location and duration of interactions between individuals, thus having a model that can reproduce the spread of the virus due to human-to-human contact. Our results show the potential of our framework to closely simulate the virus spread based on real agent-to-agent contacts. We believe that this could become a powerful tool for policymakers to make informed decisions in future pandemics and to better communicate the impact of such decisions to the general public.},

A special challenge arises from the dependence of the behavior on the density of the scene. In the literature, deep learning algorithms show the best performance in predicting pedestrian trajectories, but so far just for situations with low densities. In this study, we aim to investigate the suitability of these algorithms for high-density scenarios by evaluating them on different error metrics and comparing their accuracy to that of knowledge-based models that have been used since long time in the literature.
The findings indicate that deep learning algorithms provide improved trajectory prediction accuracy in the distance metrics for all tested densities. Nevertheless, we observe a significant number of collisions in the predictions, especially in high-density scenarios. This issue arises partly due to the absence of a collision avoidance mechanism within the algorithms and partly because the distance-based collision metric is inadequate for dense situations. To address these limitations, we propose the introduction of a novel continuous collision metric based on pedestrians' time-to-collision. Subsequently, we outline how this metric can be utilized to enhance the training of the algorithms.},
